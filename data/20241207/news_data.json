(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy.\nAQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998,\u00a0 dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology.\nCliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum.\nAsness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable.\nAQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility.\nStory Continues\nAQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments.\n\"We let the machine decide more,\"\nAsness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition.\nOur Methodology:\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nPosition size: $855 million\nActivity: -6%\nThe last time we covered AQR's META position was 6 months ago when AQR had $862 million invested in the stock. Here is what we said then:\n\"The first quarter of 2024 witnessed Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) launch Generative AI image expansion tools for Facebook and Instagram reels, which have been widely adopted by small businesses. Meta also introduced its next generation of custom chips to handle AI workloads, that enhances compute, memory bandwidth, and efficiency for ranking and recommendation models.\nMeta Platforms is further expanding on AI to optimize ad targeting and recommendation systems, driving engagement and advertising revenue. In Q1, Meta's revenue surged 27% to $36.5 billion, with 97% of this revenue sourced from ads. Ads revenue is projected to grow by 17% in 2024. Reels, a platform showing strong engagement, increased its ad load to 20% in Q1, up from 16.2% the previous year. Despite Meta's impressive Q1 results, the stock faced a decline after announcing a CapEx forecast of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion. Analysts view the increased spending positively, especially for AI projects, anticipating long-term benefits for the stock.\"\nAQR Capital hasn't materially changed its stance towards META stock over the last 6 months. It still has $855 million invested in the stock despite the 25% gain in META shares. Basically AQR has been trimming its position in META to keep the invested amount around $850 million level.\nOverall META ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other tech stocks.\nIn a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment.\nMethodology\nWe first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 235\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a technology company known for its popular social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. With over 3 billion daily active users across its services, it has established a vast user base. Recently, it leveraged its expertise in AI and AR to enhance its product offerings. In September, the company launched its AR glasses, Orion, alongside the release of its most affordable mixed-reality headset, Meta Quest 36.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), in November, also announced that it would make its open-source AI model, Llama, available to US government agencies dedicated to national security applications. This initiative aims to enhance the efficacy of government operations through advanced AI solutions. Llama has already been adopted by several major technology companies, positioning it as a breakthrough for the company and differentiating it in the competitive AI landscape.\nThe company is pioneering advertising technology using AI, which presents challenges for competitors attempting to replicate its success. As it continues to innovate and expand its technological capabilities, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is poised to maintain its leadership role.\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cWe are pleased to report that\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The law doesn\u2019t specifically ban TikTok but blocks app stores like Apple\u2019s (AAPL) App Store or Google's (GOOG) Play Store from distributing it unless ByteDance divests itself from the social network.\nWhile the decision is a setback for TikTok, it\u2019s not the end of the story. ByteDance is expected to appeal the law to the Supreme Court, which will make the ultimate call on the matter. If the law ultimately moves forward, it would be a huge blow to TikTok content creators, advertisers, and the app\u2019s 170 million users.\nBut one company will undeniably benefit from a TikTok ban: Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta (META).\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe tech giant is not only TikTok\u2019s largest competitor but also the closest mainstream social media app with a similar user base and feature set. Meta designed Reels, which Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked up during the company\u2019s earnings calls, as a means of combating the rise of TikTok.\nInstagram introduced Reels in 2020, positioning it as a way for users to explore more of the content available on the photo- and video-sharing app. Since then, Meta has used AI to further tweak its recommendation feed, making Reels ever more compelling and ensuring users not only try out the feature but continue to scroll through video after video, just as they do on TikTok.\nMark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta, speaks during an appearance at SIGGRAPH 2024. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe moves are paying off too. During Meta\u2019s Q1 earnings call in April, Zuckerberg said that Reels usage makes up 50% of the time users spend on Instagram. And during the company\u2019s Q3 earnings call in October, CFO Susan Li said that 60% of Reels\u2019 recommendations come from original content, which is exactly what gets people to stick around and keep scrolling.\nMeta doesn\u2019t break out exactly how much revenue Reels contributes to the company\u2019s bottom line, but Li previously stated that the feature is a positive contributor to Meta\u2019s overall revenue.\nWith Reels performing well, TikTok content creators will likely move over to the service if their app of choice is ultimately banned in the US. Users that follow those creators would then follow suit and advertisers along with them, ultimately helping to boost Meta\u2019s revenue.\nShares of Meta jumped 2% Friday.\nMeta certainly isn\u2019t the only TikTok rival that could benefit if the app is banned. YouTube Shorts could also get a boost, which would similarly bring more advertising dollars to the Google-owned (GOOG, GOOGL) short-form video service.\nThe TikTok ban law spawned out of national security concerns related to the company\u2019s parent company ByteDance and its ties to the Chinese government. US officials fear that the Chinese government could force TikTok to spy on American users or use the app to spread pro-China propaganda.\nStory Continues\nTikTok has denied the accusations, and the US hasn\u2019t provided any direct evidence that the Chinese government is actively using the app to surveil its user base.\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped members of Congress from taking action. The battle over TikTok is now likely headed to the Supreme Court. There's also the outside chance that President-elect Trump could intervene on TikTok's behalf.\nWhile Trump originally initiated moves to ban the social media app, he's since softened his stance on the platform.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Unfortunately for most investors, Magnificent Seven shares are so expensive that they're largely out of reach if you're not already wealthy (or close to it). Thankfully, that isn't the case because of a unique exchange-traded fund (ETF) that allows you to own shares in four Magnificent Seven stocks simultaneously.\nDon't Miss:\nThis well known prop trading firm is offering 100% of your first $25,000 profit per account and 90% after that. Here's how to get a special 50% OFF CODE that lets you start out with monthly investments as low as $147 today.\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF heavily focuses on big tech, which accounts for 61.4% of the 71 stocks in the ETF's portfolio. However, 45% of the ETF's portfolio is invested in Apple (13.36%), Amazon (6.82%), Microsoft (12.35%) and Nvidia (12.52%). Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia are all at the forefront of the AI revolution, while Amazon has become a dominant force in e-commerce.\nThat's impressive enough, but the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF doesn't stop there. Regarding weight allocation, every S&P 500 Magnificent Seven member is included in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's top ten. That means you'll also be investing in Meta and Tesla. The fund also holds shares in market share and sector powerhouses like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco and McDonalds.\nSee Also: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\nAll these companies offer products and services in high demand from large segments of the buying public. They also have a level of global recognition that is difficult to overestimate. According to Ycharts, the combined market cap of the S&P 500 Magnificent Seven is over $16 trillion. Ycharts data also shows that Magnificent Seven heavyweights Google, Nvidia and Microsoft are up by nearly 50% in 2024.\nThe same data also reveals the Magnificent Seven stocks have been responsible for 64.1% of the S&P 500's market cap growth for the year. So, when you buy into the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, you buy shares in multiple companies that have grown rapidly throughout 2024. They also look set for continued growth in 2025 and beyond.\nStory Continues\nTrying to buy individual shares in these companies would be cost-prohibitive for all but the most successful everyday investors. However, you can buy Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF shares for $350.36 (according to Vanguard website). Vanguard's public filings also indicate that the Mega Cap Growth ETF has increased in value by an incredible 35% in 2024.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nThe 10-year return (per Vanguard) is an impressive 16.30%, meaning this ETF also has potential as a buy-and-hold investment that can grow your wealth significantly. Although this ETF focuses more on growth than passive income, it currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.374 per share. It's easy to see the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's potential when you look at the total package.\nThe downside risk is that the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's continued performance is heavily tied to big tech's fortunes. The AI revolution is pushing companies like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia into the stratosphere regarding value, but nothing goes up forever. That's why even though this ETF is highly diversified, putting all your eggs in this one basket may not be wise.\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities? The Benzinga Real Estate Screener features the latest offerings.\nThis article If You Like Big Tech, You'll Love This ETF That Lets You Invest in Microsoft, Nvidia And Apple At The Same Time originally appeared on Benzinga.com\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other tech stocks.\nIn a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment.\nMethodology\nWe first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nHere is Why Warren Buffett Sold AAPL Stock\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading technology company known for its cutting-edge products. Its most popular products include the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watches, and AirPods. Its dedication to user experience has cultivated a loyal customer base, and its subscription services, including Apple Music and Apple TV+, are experiencing significant growth.\nIt has made strides in the AI sector with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, a system designed to enhance user experience across its devices. Launched in June, Apple Intelligence aims to deliver personalized AI experiences through generative models that integrate seamlessly into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\nThe company's collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) marks a pivotal move in its AI strategy. In December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported that it is currently using AWS\u2019 custom AI chips for services like search. By utilizing AWS' Trainium 2 chips for pre-training its models, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) enhances its AI capabilities while positioning itself competitively against major players like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. This partnership underscores the company's commitment to leveraging external expertise while maintaining its focus on privacy and security.\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:in) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

The technology is slated to be part of the iPhone SE, the company\u2019s entry-level smartphone, which will be updated next year for the first time since 2022.\nA modem is a critical piece of any mobile phone, letting the device connect to cell towers in order to make calls and link up with the internet. Apple\u2019s first version of the component will be followed by further generations that become increasingly more advanced. The company aims to ultimately overtake Qualcomm\u2019s technology by 2027, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project is confidential.\nApple\u2019s modem has been a long time coming. When the company set out to build the chip, it originally hoped to bring it to market as early as 2021. To jump-start the effort, the company invested billions of dollars to set up testing and engineering labs around the world. It also spent about $1 billion to acquire Intel Corp.\u2019s modem group and millions more hiring engineers from other silicon companies.\nOver the years, Apple encountered setback after setback. Early prototypes were too large, ran too hot and weren\u2019t power-efficient enough. There also were concerns internally that Apple was simply developing a modem to get back at Qualcomm, following a legal battle over licensing payments that didn\u2019t go the iPhone maker\u2019s way.\nBut after adjusting development practices, reorganizing management and hiring scores of new engineers from Qualcomm itself, Apple is now confident that its modem plan will work, the people said. It would be a major win for the company\u2019s hardware technologies team, which is run by Senior Vice President Johny Srouji.\nRepresentatives for Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment.\nQualcomm has long been preparing for Apple to switch away from its modems, but the company still receives more than 20% of its revenue from the iPhone maker, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its stock fell as much as 2% to a session low after Bloomberg News reported on Apple\u2019s plans Friday. It closed at $159.51 in New York trading, down less than 1%.\nStory Continues\nShares of Qorvo Inc., another component supplier at risk of being replaced by Apple\u2019s modem efforts, declined as much as 6% before recovering. Apple shares were little changed.\nWhen the iPhone SE debuts in a few months, it will have major new features, including Apple Intelligence and the edge-to-edge screen design already used in more upscale models. But its most impressive breakthrough won\u2019t be visible to consumers: the in-house modem, code-named Sinope.\nFor now, the modem won\u2019t be used in Apple\u2019s higher-end products. It\u2019s set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year, code-named D23, that features a far-thinner design than current models. The chip will also start rolling out as early as 2025 in Apple\u2019s lower-end iPads.\nIn preparation for the iPhone SE, Cupertino, California-based Apple has been secretly testing the new modem on hundreds of devices deployed to employees globally. And it has been doing quality assurance testing with its carrier partners around the world.\nThe company decided to start with lower-end products in part because a modem is a risky endeavor: If it doesn\u2019t work properly, customers will suffer dropped calls and missed notifications. There\u2019s little tolerance for that on Apple\u2019s highest-end, $1,000-plus iPhones.\nMoreover, Sinope isn\u2019t as advanced as the latest modems from San Diego-based Qualcomm, meaning the first Apple modem is a downgrade from the component currently in the iPhone 16 Pro.\nUnlike today\u2019s high-end Qualcomm parts, the Sinope modem won\u2019t support mmWave, a type of 5G technology used by Verizon Wireless and other carriers, primarily in major cities, that can theoretically handle download speeds of as much as 10 gigabits per second. Instead, the Apple component will rely on the Sub-6 standard, a more prevalent technology used by the current iPhone SE.\nThe first Apple modem will also only support four-carrier aggregation, a technology that combines bands from several wireless providers simultaneously to increase network capacity and speeds. Modems from Qualcomm can support six or more carriers at the same time.\nIn lab tests, the first Apple modem caps out at download speeds of about 4 gigabits per second, less than the top speeds offered by non-mmWave Qualcomm modems, the people said. Real world speeds for both types of modems are typically far less, meaning that customers might not notice a difference in day-to-day use.\nIn any case, the first Apple modem will have several other advantages that the company believes will give it an edge with consumers. For one, it will be tightly integrated with Apple-designed main processors to use less power, scan for cellular service more efficiently and better support on-device features for connecting to satellite networks.\nThe Apple modem will also be able to offer better performance relative to SAR limits because it will be managed intelligently via the main processor, the people said. SAR, or specific absorption rate, is a measure of the radio frequency absorbed by the body, and government agencies such as the US Federal Communications Commission regulate acceptable levels.\nApple is also planning to include support for DSDS, or dual SIM dual standby. That allows data connections on both SIM cards when a user is using two phone numbers for their device.\nThe new modem will be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the manufacturer of the main processors inside the iPhone, iPad, Mac and other Apple devices.\nTo help build its modem, Apple rapidly expanded its office space in San Diego and other parts of Southern California, looking to poach talent from Qualcomm. Executives involved in the modem\u2019s development believe that some of the resources and talent acquired from Intel in 2019 were inadequate, and that hiring from Qualcomm helped Apple overcome earlier setbacks.\nSome of the development work for the modems has also taken place in Cupertino and offices in Munich.\nThe modem will work with another new Apple component: a radio frequency front-end system, or RFFE, called Carpo that helps devices connect to cellular networks.\nThat part will also take away business from Qualcomm, and could eventually affect Qorvo as well. Today, Apple uses Skyworks Solutions Inc. and Broadcom Inc. for so-called RF filters \u2014 relationships that will continue. Apple and Broadcom extended their supply agreement in 2023.\nShares of Broadcom gained 5.3%, while Skyworks climbed 1.7%.\nIn 2026, Apple looks to get closer to Qualcomm\u2019s capabilities with its second-generation modem, which will start appearing in higher-end products. This chip, Ganymede, is expected to go into the iPhone 18 line that year, as well as upscale iPads by 2027\nThe big difference is that Ganymede will catch up to current Qualcomm modems by adding support for mmWave, download speeds of 6 gigabits per second, six-carrier aggregation when using Sub-6, and eight-carrier aggregation when using mmWave.\nIn 2027, Apple aims to roll out its third modem, code-named Prometheus. The company hopes to top Qualcomm with that component\u2019s performance and artificial intelligence features by that point. It will also build in support for next-generation satellite networks.\nFurther out, Apple is discussing merging its modem and main processor into a single component.\n(Update shares in shares starting in eighth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDubai\u2019s Alleged Crypto Scams Are Raking in Billions\nThe Quest to Turn Human Waste Into Medicine\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to invest in now.\nThe Downsides to Stocks Rallying Higher\nStocks in the United States are rallying high, but some strategists are eyeing a few risks. On December 5, Max Kettner, Chief Multi-Asset Strategist at HSBC, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the market outlook heading into 2025. Kettner shared that investors and analysts alike hold extremely bullish expectations of the market in 2025. While that may likely be true, an extremely bullish market may pose a significant risk and have multiple downsides.\nHe stated that the market will likely see strong upsides on the earnings front, leading to higher yields, which will leave a question on the future of the cutting cycle and whether the Fed will have to commence a rate hike again. He emphasized that higher terminal rates will bring in bond volatility and impact nearly every risk asset in the market.\nSpeaking of positives, Kettner highlighted that the next few quarters exhibit pretty low growth expectations and earnings expectations for the S&P. He reiterated that with a much lower growth rate, the cutting cycle will be executed as planned. As for inflation, he highlighted the importance of super core inflation, also referred to as underlying inflation. He believes super core inflation is more likely to decline, especially in the first half of the year, adding that he is not as worried about inflation as he was almost three to four months ago.\nKettner stated that the next six to seven months will deliver a supportive market environment for equities in the S&P, especially for global equities. He also believes that the market will see a 12% to 13% upside in the next 12 months until the end of 2025. While Kettner remained inclined to tech stocks, he added that other sectors, such as industrials, will also see a \u201cmini re-acceleration.\u201d\nHe emphasized that the market rally will go beyond the S&P especially with the current \u201cgoldilocks\u201d backdrop, high growth projections, and consensus expectations, benefiting other asset classes. Kettner shared that the ideal portfolio for investors will be tech stocks and a combination of stocks in other sectors, especially industrials and US banks. He added that these sectors are likely to benefit from regulatory changes and the current economic backdrop.\nAs economic and political turmoil encapsulates the market, some stocks have been performing consistently well over the years, positioned as solid investments, especially for new investors. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 11 best beginner stocks to invest in now.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 11 best beginner stocks to invest in now, we compiled a list of the top blue chip stocks. We then tracked the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nWhy Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is The Best Beginner Stock To Invest In Now?\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best beginner stocks to invest in right now. The company behind the iPhone also sells a range of digital and entertainment products including iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+. The company beat its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings expectations by reporting $94.9 billion in revenue which was up by 6% year-over-year. Of this, its product revenue accounted for nearly $70 billion and its services segment generated $24.9 billion. Its business performance brought in almost $27 billion in operating cash flow, making it possible for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to return more than $29 billion to its shareholders.\nDuring the quarter, the company not only released its new product line-up but made significant advances in Apple Intelligence. Keeping the momentum in check, on October 30, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched new chips, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max, built to boost efficiency and performance. Not only is the chip faster than previous versions but it also has a greater memory bandwidth. In addition to that, the chip is built to support two external displays, separate from a built-in display. On the same day, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced that the new MacBook Pro now comes with the powerful M4 chip and is built to seamlessly power Apple Intelligence.\nThe company not only has a solid ecosystem with a loyal customer base, but it is also innovating its offerings to enhance the customer experience and attract new ones.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also annonced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple\u2019s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn\u2019t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\u201d\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of best beginner stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "(Reuters) - Apple is preparing to launch its long-awaited series of cellular modem chips next year, which will replace components from longtime partner Qualcomm, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.\nThe iPhone maker is looking to ultimately overtake Qualcomm's technology by 2027, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.\nQualcomm, a leading designer of modem chips that connect phones to mobile data networks, has warned investors that Apple will eventually stop using its chips.\nThe chip designer has a deal to keep selling chips to Apple until at least 2026 and investors are keen to see if Qualcomm's push into laptops and AI-powered data centers can accelerate quickly enough to compensate for potential drops in revenue from Apple.\nApple's new component is set to feature in the iPhone SE, the company's entry-level smartphone, which is scheduled for its first update since 2022 next year, the Bloomberg News report said, adding that it will be followed by further generations of increasingly advanced chips.\nQualcomm did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, while Apple declined to comment.\nThe iPhone maker has been working on its own modem technology and spent $1 billion to buy Intel's modem unit in 2019.\nIn early 2019, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signaling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.\nLast year, Apple signed a multi-billion-dollar deal with chipmaker Broadcom to develop 5G radio frequency components. Such a deal could hurt companies such as Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo, both of which are Apple suppliers.\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Alan Barona)\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financials) attracted market interest when KeyBanc Capital Markets offered fresh analysis from recent data including Black Friday buying patterns and a November iPhone carrier survey.\nKeyBanc researchers saw some modest gains, but they also pointed out possible difficulties for the IT behemoth.\nAnalysts John Vinh and Brandon Nispel said that, following usual seasonal trends, Apple 16 sales in November somewhat outperformed estimates. Especially, demand for the Apple 16 Pro and Pro Max was strong while the lower versions kept underperformance. Reflecting good stock conditions, inventory levels somewhat rose but stayed below previous-year levels.\nFollowing the ban on Apple 16 sales resulting from non-compliance with local content rules, Apple revealed in recent news a $1 billion investment in a manufacturing facility in Indonesia to make components for its devices. Apple's larger attempt to follow regional regulations and increase its manufacturing presence includes this investment.\nApple's new artificial intelligence emphasis attracted a little amount of curiosity, but it had little influence on near-term iPhone demand. Though Black Friday spending increased by 9% year over year, more general November expenditure dropped 6% month-on-month, deviating from the regular three-year average of a 3% growth.\nKeybanc maintained Apple's Underweight rating and set a price target of $200. Their \"First Look Data\" shows that iPhone sales increased by 2% sequentially and by 5% from the year before. These numbers still fell short of usual seasonal standards, however, indicating the lack of a significant Apple 16 upgrade increase.\nApple's product portfolio has also changed somewhat lately. The company shelved many earlier models including the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPhone 13 to make room for the new iPhone 16 lineup; Apple also revealed a redesigned iPad Mini model, which resulted in the iPad Mini 6 being pulled from stores. Likewise, Series 10 replaced the Apple Watch Series 9, while USB-C versions of the Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard replaced Lightning versions of each. Apple's continuous aim to simplify its product range and fit new technological criteria includes these developments.\nKeyBanc came to the conclusion that Apple's fourth fiscal quarter's data shows a \"modestly negative\" perspective, expecting development to line historical norms rather than displaying any notable increase. Moreover, they pointed out that previous comparisons revealed no significant deviations even when Apple introduced a new MacBook Pro in November, same as last year.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Apple (AAPL, Financials) is balancing government subsidies with iPhone 17 Air issues in China, a new note from analyst Jefferies.\nAs these mixed elements play out, analysts forecast the shares of the IT behemoth will stay \"range bound\" in the short future.\nConsumer subsidies have lately been established in China by recent projects; provinces of Jiangsu and Guizhou have discounted cellphones and other goods up to 15%. Especially, Apple items are part of Jiangsu's agenda, which experts see as a calculated action by China to offset possible rises in U.S. taxes. Currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2024, the initiative may be extended should it be judged effective. Jefferies analysts observed that such projects may spread to other provinces, hence augmenting consumer demand.\nBut Apple's thinnest model to date, the iPhone 17 Air, may have trouble in the Chinese market because it depends only on eSIM technology. With many customers depending on dual-SIM capability to gain from cheaper data plans without changing phone numbers, China's legislative structure and market behavior mostly support physical SIM cards. Jefferies pointed out that this design decision would restrict the acceptance of the iPhone 17 Air in among Apple's biggest regions.\nApart from these particular problems, Apple is facing more general difficulties like continuous trade conflicts between the United States and China and criticism over its search deal with Alphabet's (GOOG, Financials) Google among antitrust probes. Although these elements might affect Apple's activities, Jefferies analysts pointed out that they are unlikely to generate notable short-term variations in the stock price of the business.\nJefferies underlined that while tariff dynamics and government subsidies might affect the direction of the business, no one element seems powerful enough to propel significant movement in the stock.\nApple unveiled its iPhone 16 series in the fiscal fourth quarter. Particularly with the integration of Apple Intelligence, which is anticipated to drive a major upgrade cycle, analysts predict that the full effect of the new models will become evident in the next quarter.\nApple stock is last changing hands for $243.04, up 30.9% for the year thus far.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other tech stocks.\nIn a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively.

          "whole_article": "Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos likes his documents crisp and his meetings messy.\nThat might sound like a head-scratcher at first read, but the former Amazon CEO and current executive chairman discussed how he maximizes meeting productivity at the New York Times DealBook Summit on Wednesday.\n\u2022 USD\n(AMZN)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nBezos\u2019s six-page meeting memos have long been the stuff of corporate lore. For those unfamiliar, he disseminates a lengthy epistle at the top of a meeting and allows executives 30 minutes to peruse it. Upon completion, they regroup to discuss the content and embark on a shared objective. This approach, Bezos said, prevents executives from coming in with prepared platitudes, fostering a \u201cmessy discussion\u201d where curiosity abounds and meeting members meander from topic to topic.\n\u201cI like the memos to be like angels seeing it from high. It\u2019s so clear and beautiful, and then the meeting can be messy,\u201d said Bezos. \u201cI want the meetings to wander.\u201d\nBecause of the messy nature of his meetings, Bezos admitted they usually run late. But he\u2019s fine with that outcome because these meetings tend to spark creative idea generation and encourage collaboration. \u201cThe only meeting I\u2019m ever on time [for] is my first meeting, because I won\u2019t finish a meeting until I\u2019m really finished,\u201d he said.\nTo discourage groupthink and prevent top executives\u2019 opinions from influencing other attendees, the most junior person speaks first, followed by the next most senior, and so on. Bezos acknowledged that he, too, can be susceptible to others\u2019 opinions: \u201cI\u2019ve realized I\u2019m a very easy person to influence. I change my mind a lot, but a couple of a percent of the time, no force in the world can move me, because I\u2019m so sure of something.\u201d\nSo what exactly constitutes a messy meeting? Bezos said it allows participants to wander in discussion, get into the controversy, and share dissenting opinions. In fact, Bezos so prefers messy meetings that he becomes skeptical when they seem too structured. He recounted an Amazon meeting that he knew was clearly rehearsed. \u201cI could tell by the little tiny cues,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI told them, \u2018Don\u2019t do that again. You don\u2019t need to.\u2019\u201d\nBezos doesn\u2019t want to feel like employees are pitching him or his executive team a fully fleshed idea or concept. He\u2019d rather be part of the action. \u201cYou want to be part of the sausage making. Show me the ugly bits,\u201d he said.\nBut Bezos warned that not all meetings should be messy. His weekly business reviews, for instance, were more formulaic at Amazon and had a preset agenda. Meetings about selling a new product should not be messy either, he said. \u201cYou want all of your ducks in a row, and you want to put your best foot forward.\u201d\nStory Continues\nMeetings are also an opportunity to deepen relationships with employees, Bezos said, noting that he makes an effort to speak candidly about changes that are needed or when he feels scared about the company\u2019s ability to successfully deliver on a project. Yet he added that while it\u2019s fine to express negative emotions, an optimistic outlook is a must for leaders, especially entrepreneurs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how some glum, Eeyore-type founder could ever lead a company to success,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have some energy, and it\u2019s got to be a little contagious. There\u2019s going to be a lot of bad days, [so] you\u2019ve got to lift people up.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "It's been a tough year for Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) as consumers pinch pennies and uncertainty looms in the road ahead.\n\"The retail landscape is definitely changing quite a bit. Right now, we have a lot of big winners Walmart, Amazon, and other companies that are struggling,\" R5 Capital founder and CEO Scott Mushkin told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief.\nAs shoppers seek value, stores like Walmart (WMT) that have cheap groceries as a draw are grabbing market share. On top of that, President-elect Trump's potential tariffs could be another hit for the industry.\nBoth companies reported muted earnings results this week.\nDollar General's same-store sales grew 1.3% in the third quarter, compared to the 0.97% Wall Street expected. That was driven by an increase in transaction size and a 0.3% boost in foot traffic. Its grocery business continues to attract shoppers while home, seasonal, and apparel segments remain soft.\nIts revenue of $10.18 billion beat the $10.14 billion expected. Adjusted earnings came in at $0.89 per share, missing the $0.94 estimate. It expects fourth quarter sales to grow between 1.1% and 1.4% year over year.\nDollar General's \"core customer remains financially constrained,\" CEO Todd Vasos said on its Thursday earnings call. Its shoppers are \"less able to stretch their budgets at the end of the month,\" he added.\n\u2022 USD\n(DLTR)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nDollar Tree's same-store sales are up 1.8% from a year ago, beating the 1.38% expected, boosted by an increase in the average ticket and a 1.5% uptick in foot traffic.\nIts revenue of $7.56 billion also bested estimates of $7.47 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.12, versus estimates of $1.08.\nDollar Tree's interim CEO Michael Creedon said on the earnings call that there's ongoing \"evidence of belt-tightening, particularly among lower-income customers, and to a lesser extent, among middle- and higher-income families with young children.\"\nDollar Tree CFO Jeff Davis said November same-store sales \"got off to a slow start\" as consumers \"defer shopping trips to closely follow the ins and outs of a national election.\" The company is also bracing for the impact of a shorter holiday season.\nFor the fourth quarter, Dollar Tree expects same-store sales growth of low single-digits for both its namesake business and its Family Dollar chain.\nThe Dollar General convenience store logo is displayed on a truck on Aug. 30, 2024, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images) \u00b7 Brandon Bell via Getty Images\nJoe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group said Dollar Tree \"continues to make progress on several company-specific initiatives\" like offering multiple price points and Family Dollar remodels, as the acquisition remains a headache.\nStory Continues\nHowever, he recommends a Hold rating on the stock due to \"tough consumer spending trends among the company's core customers and increased competition from the likes of Walmart.\"\nThe company is also in the midst of searching for a new CEO and CFO.\nFormer CEO Rick Dreiling resigned in early November, citing health issues. The company announced this week that Davis plans to step down early next year\nForrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali is more optimistic about the company's future potential, she told Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith.\n\"If I had to pick, I'd probably say that Dollar Tree has a little bit of an edge because it's embarking on a broader tiered pricing strategy to try to bring some of its price points up.\"\nShares of both dollar store chains are down more than 40% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's 27% gain.\nIn early September, investors fled from Dollar Tree after it missed Wall Street estimates across key metrics for its second quarter and revised down its 2024 outlook.\nDollar Tree now expects 2024 revenue in the range of $30.7 billion to $30.9 billion, compared to $30.6 billion in 2023. It provided a vague same-store sales outlook of low-single-digits.\nSimilarly, Dollar General posted a miss for its Q2 report in late August that hammered the stock.\nFor fiscal year 2024, Dollar General expects sales growth of 4.8% to 5.1%, versus the previous range of 4.7% to 5.3%. Same-store sales growth is projected at 1.1% to 1.4%, compared to the previous range of 1% to 1.6%.\nLast week, Trump posted on Truth Social that his administration plans to impose an additional 10% tariff on imports from China and a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada on Jan. 20, his first day in office.\nThe proposal could hit discount retailers that have limited room to raise prices particularly hard.\nCreedon told investors, \"It's still unclear what will make its way to policy.\" He added that he believes the team can mitigate risk based on its experience in 2018 and 2019.\nThe company can \"change some of the specs on the product, ... negotiate furiously with our suppliers, or they can eliminate the product altogether,\" he said.\nDollar General, on the other hand, didn't mention tariffs during its earnings call.\n\u2014\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best beginner stocks to invest in now.\nThe Downsides to Stocks Rallying Higher\nStocks in the United States are rallying high, but some strategists are eyeing a few risks. On December 5, Max Kettner, Chief Multi-Asset Strategist at HSBC, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the market outlook heading into 2025. Kettner shared that investors and analysts alike hold extremely bullish expectations of the market in 2025. While that may likely be true, an extremely bullish market may pose a significant risk and have multiple downsides.\nHe stated that the market will likely see strong upsides on the earnings front, leading to higher yields, which will leave a question on the future of the cutting cycle and whether the Fed will have to commence a rate hike again. He emphasized that higher terminal rates will bring in bond volatility and impact nearly every risk asset in the market.\nSpeaking of positives, Kettner highlighted that the next few quarters exhibit pretty low growth expectations and earnings expectations for the S&P. He reiterated that with a much lower growth rate, the cutting cycle will be executed as planned. As for inflation, he highlighted the importance of super core inflation, also referred to as underlying inflation. He believes super core inflation is more likely to decline, especially in the first half of the year, adding that he is not as worried about inflation as he was almost three to four months ago.\nKettner stated that the next six to seven months will deliver a supportive market environment for equities in the S&P, especially for global equities. He also believes that the market will see a 12% to 13% upside in the next 12 months until the end of 2025. While Kettner remained inclined to tech stocks, he added that other sectors, such as industrials, will also see a \u201cmini re-acceleration.\u201d\nHe emphasized that the market rally will go beyond the S&P especially with the current \u201cgoldilocks\u201d backdrop, high growth projections, and consensus expectations, benefiting other asset classes. Kettner shared that the ideal portfolio for investors will be tech stocks and a combination of stocks in other sectors, especially industrials and US banks. He added that these sectors are likely to benefit from regulatory changes and the current economic backdrop.\nAs economic and political turmoil encapsulates the market, some stocks have been performing consistently well over the years, positioned as solid investments, especially for new investors. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 11 best beginner stocks to invest in now.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 11 best beginner stocks to invest in now, we compiled a list of the top blue chip stocks. We then tracked the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nWhy Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is The Best Beginner Stock To Invest In Now?\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 286\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks first on our list of the best beginner stocks to invest in right now. The technology company is an e-commerce giant that also provides streaming and data cloud services. The company launched its e-commerce platform in 1994 and is now close to capturing 40% of the market in the United States. In addition to its growing customer base, the company also has a strong cash flow situation. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) generated $112.7 billion in operating cash flow, up by 57% from the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2023. During the same period, the company increased its free cash flow to $47.7 billion, up from $21.4 billion in 2023.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) expects net sales to range between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, up by 7-11% year-over-year. Operating income, on the other hand, is expected to range between $16 billion and $20 billion, up from $13.2 billion during the fourth quarter of 2023. Overall, AMZN is seeing significant growth in AWS sales and its international segment, with sustained growth in its North America segment. At the end of Q3 2024, 286 hedge funds held stakes in AMZN, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of best beginner stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

          "whole_article": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk - Photo: Anna Moneymaker (Getty Images)\nElon Musk has weighed in on comments from his rivals downplaying the idea that he would abuse his growing political power.\nEarlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and other tech and business leaders who have crossed Musk in the past are worried about his influential relationship with Donald Trump. Publicly, both Bezos and Altman have downplayed their fears.\nBezos said this week at the annual New York Times DealBook Summit that he\u2019s \u201coptimistic this time around\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s second presidential administration, which Musk has had a key role in laying the ground for. Bezos, who is now focused on his aerospace company Blue Origin, called Musk\u2019s SpaceX \u201cvery good competitors,\u201d adding that he doubts Musk would use his influence unjustly.\n\u201cI take it face value, what has been said, which is that he\u2019s not going to use his political power to advantage his own companies or to disadvantage his competitors,\u201d Bezos said, adding that he \u201ccould be wrong about that, but I think it could be true.\u201d\nAltman, also speaking at DealBook, said that he believes \u201cpretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing,\u201d adding that it would be \u201cprofoundly un-American to use political power\u201d to hurt competitors. His comments come even as Altman has reportedly reached out to his connections in Trump\u2019s circle, including Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who Trump tapped to lead the Commerce Department.\n\u201cThey are right,\u201d Musk chimed in Friday on his social media platform, X.\nBoth Bezos and Altman would have good reason to fear a vengeful Musk with political power.\nBezos and Musk have had a few public spats in recent years. Blue Origin has protested a contract NASA gave SpaceX and sought to limit SpaceX\u2019s Starship launches, while Amazon\u2019s Kuiper has opposed SpaceX\u2019s plans to expand its Starlink satellite network. In 2020, Musk called for the government to break up Amazon, complaining about monopolies.\nAs for Altman, Musk was an OpenAi co-founder in 2015 before he left over a conflict of interest in 2018. A few years later, he launched his own artificial intelligence startup, xAI, which just secured another $6 billion in funding, according to a regulatory filing. Musk has sued OpenAI and has asked a federal court to stop it from becoming a for-profit business and to prevent it from allegedly requiring investors to refrain from funding rivals, including xAI.\n\u2014Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for MercadoLibre (MELI). Shares have added about 11.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MercadoLibre due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nMercadoLibre's Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues Rise Y/Y\nMercadoLibre reported third-quarter 2024 earnings of $7.83 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.52% but increased 9.4% year over year.\nRevenues rose 35% on a year-over-year basis (103% on a FX-neutral basis) to $5.3 billion. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.11%.\nTotal revenues were driven by accelerating commerce and fintech revenues, which grew 48% and 21% year over year to $2.12 billion and $1.79 billion, respectively.\nRevenues from MELI\u2019s advertising services grew 37% on a year-over-year basis and were equivalent to almost 2% of gross merchandise volume (GMV) at the end of the third quarter.\nIncreasing total payments volume (TPV), courtesy of the robust Mercado Pago, aided the company. MercadoLibre\u2019s rising GMV remained another positive. Strong momentum across Brazil and Mexico also contributed well to the reported results.\nIn the third quarter, MELI opened six new fulfillment senators, five in Brazil and one in Mexico.\nQuarter in Detail\nBrazil: Net revenues in the third quarter came in at $2.91 billion (54.8% of the total revenues), rising 41.2% year over year.\nArgentina: The market generated revenues of $1.03 billion (19.4% of the top line), which grew 13.5% year over year.\nMexico: Net revenues in the reported quarter were $1.14 billion (21.6% of the total revenues), which soared 44% year over year.\nOther countries: The markets generated revenues of $221 million (4.2% of the total revenues), reflecting an increase of 39% on a year-over-year basis.\nKey Metrics\nGMV of $12.9 billion jumped 71.2% on an FX-neutral basis year over year. The figure beat the consensus mark by 0.91%.\nThe number of successful items sold was 456 million, up 27.7% year over year.\nThe number of successful items shipped rose 29.4% year over year to 453 million.\nTPV surged 72.7% year over year on a FX-neutral basis to $50.6 billion. This was driven by the strong performance of Mercado Pago. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.96%.\nTotal payment transactions increased 47.5% year over year to $2.93 billion.\nStory Continues\nFintech monthly active users totaled 56 million, up 33.3% year over year.\nOperating Details\nFor the third quarter, the gross margin was 45.9%, down from 53.6% in the year-ago-period.\nOperating expenses were $1.88 billion, which increased 43.7% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, the figure expanded 60 bps year over year to 35.4% in the reported quarter.\nThe operating margin was 10.5%, down from 20.9% in the year-ago-period.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $2.16 billion, down from $2.82 billion as of June 30, 2024.\nShort-term investments were $1.1 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024. Net debt came in at $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -20.28% due to these changes.\nVGM Scores\nCurrently, MercadoLibre has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, MercadoLibre has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\nPerformance of an Industry Player\nMercadoLibre belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry. Another stock from the same industry, Amazon (AMZN), has gained 5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2024.\nAmazon reported revenues of $158.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11%. EPS of $1.43 for the same period compares with $0.85 a year ago.\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +48.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8%.\nAmazon has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of B.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

          "whole_article": "By Siddharth Cavale\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Walmart Inc, Amazon.com and fast-growing e-commerce sites Shein and PDD Holding's Temu saw record-breaking sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to spending data, suggesting that they may finish the holiday season on a much stronger note than Target and Best Buy, which struggled.\nHoliday shoppers largely browsed at brick-and-mortar stores, making more online purchases at some retailers, snapping up such items as pre-owned Rolex watches, Pokemon cards and singer Sabrina Carpenter's perfumes at Walmart, and Fire TV streaming devices and Shark vacuums at Amazon during the deal-heavy week, which at Amazon began on Nov. 21, according to company statements.\nAmericans spent roughly $10.8 billion online on Black Friday this year, up 10.2% from the previous year, then followed that up by spending $13.3 billion on Cyber Monday, 7.3% more compared to Cyber Monday in 2023, according to Adobe.\nAmong major retailers, Amazon saw the strongest growth on Black Friday, with sales rising 6% compared to Black Friday a year earlier, according to data firm Facteus, which tracks online and in-store spending in the United States analyzing data from banks, credit unions, payment processors, and fintech companies. Its figures are not inflation adjusted.\nRival Walmart saw 3% more spending compared to the year-earlier period, while big-box chain Target and consumer electronics chain Best Buy saw declines versus a year earlier, Facteus said.\nAmong top performers on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, were low-cost China rivals Temu and Shein, clocking double-digit percentage growth sales, albeit from a lower sales base, Facteus said.\nSimilarly, on Cyber Monday, the Monday following Thanksgiving, Amazon, Walmart, Temu and privately held Shein saw an increase in sales compared to Cyber Monday 2023, while Best Buy's declined versus a year earlier. Target saw a modest increase.\nAt Target, the muted sales performance came despite exclusive merchandise partnerships with singer Taylor Swift and the Broadway show turned Hollywood movie, \"Wicked,\" which were expected to give it a boost.\nAccording to research firm Circana, Target's exclusively available Taylor Swift \"Eras Tour Book\" sold 814,000 print units in just two days of launch, making it the second-highest adult non-fiction release behind Barack Obama's \"A Promised Land.\"\nAt Best Buy, which has struggled due to shoppers pulling back on items like TVs and laptops, sales were 2% lower on Black Friday and 4% lower on Cyber Monday compared to the year-ago periods. Still, its shares are up 2% since Thanksgiving on Nov. 28, suggesting that investors expect a better performance ahead.\nStory Continues\nSince Black Friday, Walmart and Amazon's shares have rallied 4.5% and 9.3%, respectively, outpacing the S&P 500's rise of 1.6%.\nWalmart offered four times as many deals between Black Friday and Cyber Monday on its Walmart.com marketplace, resulting in its highest single sales day ever between Nov. 25 and Dec. 2, the company said in a blog post.\nWhile the retailer did not specify which day was its sales peak, it said top products included pre-owned Rolex watches, refurbished Dyson vacuums, Pokemon cards, vintage LEGO items, and beauty products from T3, BabylissPRO, Paul Mitchell, and Victoria's Secret. Singer Sabrina Carpenter's Sweet Tooth was the most coveted fragrance, it said.\nAmazon said that the 12-day shopping period ending on Cyber Monday resulted in record sales compared to the same period in prior years, which Facteus confirmed.\nTop sellers included Medicube devices, FireTV sticks, Samsung TVs, Barbie, Play-Doh, Shark vacuums and air purifiers. Shoppers bought a record number of items, generating its highest-ever sales during a 12-day period.\nTemu generated $53.3 million in sales on Black Friday and $55.1 million on Cyber Monday, which were both records, Facteus said.\nTemu told Reuters in an email that toys, especially kids' instruments and cameras, were popular.\nSimilarly, Shein, also hit new highs, with sales of $34.2 million on Black Friday and $38.9 million on Cyber Monday, the data firm said.\n(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California, and Mark Porter)\nView Comments"

Meanwhile, most of Taiwan Semiconductor's production capacity is based in Taiwan.\nThe key Nvidia supplier targets mass production of the Blackwell chips in early 2025.\nTaiwan Semiconductor's current Arizona plant customers reportedly include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD).\nEarlier this week, Amazon.Com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit claimed that it could connect more chips than Nvidia and could train some AI models at a 40% discount to Nvidia chips.\nSee Also: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% \u2014 Investors like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nAmazon Web Services showcased its data center servers embedded with its AI chips, dubbed Trn2 UltraServers. These servers target Nvidia's flagship server, which is packed with the latest Blackwell chips.\nAmazon also disclosed that it is building artificial intelligence supercomputers in collaboration with Anthropic, which will feature Amazon's latest AI training chip, Trainium 2. Previous reports claimed Nvidia's production challenges of Blackwell chips hampered AWS' data center plans.\nDespite production challenges, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer projected several billion dollars in revenue from Blackwell for the January quarter. He noted investors are modeling between 5 and 6 million Blackwell GPUs in 2025.\nStory Continues\nNvidia stock has surged over 201% year-to-date. Taiwan Semiconductor stock gained 98%.\nInvestors can gain exposure to Nvidia through ProShares Ultra Semiconductors (NYSE:USD) and EA Series Trust Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SHOC).\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\nCurrently, Fox Corporation has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Netflix has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FOX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\nFOX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.29, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 46.41. We also note that FOX has a PEG ratio of 1.60. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.77.\nAnother notable valuation metric for FOX is its P/B ratio of 1.78. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 17.27.\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to FOX's Value grade of A and NFLX's Value grade of D.\nFOX stands above NFLX thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that FOX is the superior value option right now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +15.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 17.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nNetflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +99.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Netflix is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Investing.com -- Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s dominant position in the streaming landscape continues to strengthen, Raymond (NS:RYMD) James revealed in its 16th Semi-Annual Media Usage Survey.\nA key finding from the December 2024 survey is Netflix\u2019s rising penetration, which climbed to 56% from 50% in June 2024, marking a reversal after six consecutive declines. The service also holds the top spot as the \"most valued\" among respondents, with 51% indicating Netflix would be one of the three services they\u2019d keep if forced to choose. This figure significantly outpaces Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime (37%) and Hulu (25%).\nNetflix\u2019s ad-supported tier is also gaining traction. Approximately 68% of Netflix users reported utilizing the ad tier, up from 52% in June 2024, while an additional 11% expressed interest in potentially adopting it.\nThis combined figure of 79% marks a 12-point increase year-over-year, underscoring growing interest in cost-effective subscription options.\n\u201cNotably, the majority of incremental ad tier users switched from another Netflix plan rather than signing on from another service or external interest,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s report notes.\n\u201cNetflix has noted an ARPU (average revenue per unit) lift from Ads users vs. Basic subscription users, though Ads users are slightly ARPU-dilutive vs. Standard subscribers.\u201d\nAccording to Raymond James, consumer engagement with Netflix remains robust across demographics. Usage among younger viewers aged 18-29 rose five points to 57%, while older users saw a 13-point jump to the same level.\nMoreover, the survey highlights challenges for other streaming platforms. Max, Peacock, and Paramount+ saw declines, with Peacock dropping the most to 11% from 15%, despite strong Olympic viewership.\nAll three remain in the low double digits to mid-teens, significantly behind Netflix (51%), Amazon Prime (37%), and Disney\u2019s offerings (mid-20s). This raises questions about the market's ability to sustain so many services.\n\u201cWe think consolidation among these three services is likely, and see a combination of Paramount+ and Peacock as particularly likely given the incoming new leadership at Paramount, the companies\u2019 existing streaming partnership overseas, and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) expressing interest in this kind of partnership in Paramount\u2019s S-4,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s report notes.\nMeanwhile, broader market trends are improving, the report reveals, with viewership hours on the rise. More concretely, 75% of respondents said they watch two or more hours of video daily, compared to 70% in June 2024.\nStory Continues\nRelated Articles\nRaymond James' survey of media usage adds to never-stronger Netflix bull case\nRobinhood gains retail crypto mkt share from Coinbase\nSmith & Wesson shares drop after earnings miss, downgrades\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX).\nNetflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.91, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.91 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.1% and 4.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NFLX\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Netflix, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NFLX Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $19.78.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Netflix.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.69%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.31%.\nThe the stock of internet video service has risen by 18.1% in the past month, leading the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 10.43% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.79%.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Netflix in its upcoming earnings disclosure. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $4.20, marking a 99.05% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $10.15 billion, showing a 14.95% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $19.78 per share and revenue of $38.91 billion. These totals would mark changes of +64.42% and +15.37%, respectively, from last year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Netflix currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn the context of valuation, Netflix is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 45.62. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 9.52, which means Netflix is trading at a premium to the group.\nAlso, we should mention that NFLX has a PEG ratio of 1.74. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Broadcast Radio and Television industry was having an average PEG ratio of 0.79.\nStory Continues\nThe Broadcast Radio and Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 85, finds itself in the top 34% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine Netflix\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\nSee our latest analysis for Netflix\nWhat Is Netflix Worth?\nAccording to our valuation model, Netflix seems to be fairly priced at around 16.08% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Netflix today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $773.37, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Netflix\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from Netflix?\nNasdaqGS:NFLX Earnings and Revenue Growth December 3rd 2024\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Netflix. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NFLX\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NFLX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

          "whole_article": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares edged up over the past week from $138 to $142 which is a small move for a usually volatile stock. In this article, we will share what the Street has been saying about NVDA stock.\nAswath Damodaran\nAswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance, thinks Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is overvalued. He explained his stance while talking with CNBC\u00a0journalists and said:\n\u201cI think at this price, if you\u2019re buying, you\u2019re expecting the product and service market to be much bigger than people anticipate. You need to be clear that this is what you\u2019re basing your purchase on. Even if you assume Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI chip market\u2014which I believe they currently have\u2014and their ability to maintain these sky-high margins, you still can\u2019t justify a $144 valuation without something additional happening. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re betting on Nvidia finding and dominating another market, and that\u2019s a tough call.\u201d\nLike Damodaran, investment advisory Trefis Team is of the view that NVDA stock is overpriced while it trades at ~ 48x fiscal 2025 earnings estimates. The firm believes rival chipmaker AMD offers a more attractive entry point at 28 times forward earnings estimates for investors that want to jump on the AI bandwagon.\nWhile some think the current price isn't justified, Denmark-based Saxo Bank thinks Nvidia stock could reach $250 by the end of 2025. That would give it a $7 trillion market cap, according to Chief Macro Strategist John J. Hardy. He thinks that Nvidia is the \"primary shovel-seller in the AI gold rush\"\u00a0and sees it accounting for 10% of the global equity market next year.\nWhile not as bullish as Hardy, analysts at PhillipCapital also recently raised the price target on NVDA shares to $160 from $155 but downgraded the stock to Accumulate from Buy. According to PhillipCapital analyst Yik Ban Chong:\n\"Hyperscalers are upgrading their AI cloud capabilities to capture cloud service opportunities from Gen AI startups, H200 Hopper sales increased to \u2018double-digit billions,\u2019 the fastest product ramp in the company\u2019s history, NVDA guided that its demand will continue at least until 2H26.\u201d\nBut that's not all, Chong also took note of the potential implications of higher trade tariffs between the U.S. and China for NVDA stock:\n\"The escalation of the US-China trade war starting from July 2018 caused NVDA\u2019s stock price to fall more than 50% from its peak in October 2018. If similar tariff policies were to be imposed again, there may be a material impact on NVDA\u2019s share price.\u201d\nStory Continues\nThe impact of higher trade tariffs could present challenges for Nvidia, but what about a structural change in AI? Adam Clark, a reporter at Barron's, shared a unique perspective about a paradigm shift in AI that could impact the business of Wall Street's AI darling. AI companies are shifting their focus from developing and training large models to inferencing. Nvidia's GPUs are more appropriate for the training part of model development, and Clark reported that inferencing might bring more business to the company's competitors including AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\nOur research director also shared his views on NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nView Comments"

Per a report by news platform Al Jazeera, this is the third crackdown on American chip business with China in three years. The latest measures include curbing exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment maker Naura Technology Group, the report underlined. It added that the new rules also hit Chinese chip toolmakers Piotech, ACM Research, and SiCarrier Technology. According to the report, new export restrictions are part of the package, which also takes aim at shipments of advanced memory chips and chips tools to China.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe updated sanctions package includes curbs on China-bound shipments of high bandwidth memory chips. These chips are critical for high-end applications like AI training. The US has also introduced export curbs on chip making equipment made in countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. Through these measures, introduced just a few days before President-elect Donald Trump takes charge at the White House, the US aims to limit Chinese access to chips that can help advance artificial intelligence for military applications, or otherwise threaten US national security.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology.\nCliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum.\nAsness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable.\nAQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility.\nStory Continues\nAQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments.\n\"We let the machine decide more,\"\nAsness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition.\nOur Methodology:\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nPosition size: $1.96 billion\nActivity: 5%\nThe last time we covered AQR's NVDA investment was 6 months ago when AQR had $1.53 billion invested in NVDA stock. Here is what we said:\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its dominance in AI technology as NVIDIA delivered impressive performance driven by its AI capabilities that led to a 206% surge in its stock price over the past year. O'Malley sees a $25 billion opportunity in global AI expansion and forecasts NVIDIA's earnings to rise to $3.62 per share by fiscal 2026. NVIDIA's recent product innovations, including new AI architectures and advanced chips namely Rubin (R100), and its advanced H100 and Blackwell chips, are expected to fuel further growth. Despite a high current P/E ratio of 71, analysts view NVIDIA's forward P/E of 35.74, based on 2026 earnings estimates, as attractive given its strong growth prospects and technological leadership in the market.\"\nNothing really changed about NVDA. NVDA shares jumped from $90 at the end of the first quarter to $140 today. AQR's NVDA position increased by 30% since then. This means as NVDA shares were skyrocketing AQR took some of the profits off the table, but still let its position size grow unlike what it did with some of the other megacap stocks. This means NVDA is really AQR's #1 megacap stock pick as the quant hedge fund owns 0.07% of NVDA's outstanding shares.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Unfortunately for most investors, Magnificent Seven shares are so expensive that they're largely out of reach if you're not already wealthy (or close to it). Thankfully, that isn't the case because of a unique exchange-traded fund (ETF) that allows you to own shares in four Magnificent Seven stocks simultaneously.\nDon't Miss:\nThis well known prop trading firm is offering 100% of your first $25,000 profit per account and 90% after that. Here's how to get a special 50% OFF CODE that lets you start out with monthly investments as low as $147 today.\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF heavily focuses on big tech, which accounts for 61.4% of the 71 stocks in the ETF's portfolio. However, 45% of the ETF's portfolio is invested in Apple (13.36%), Amazon (6.82%), Microsoft (12.35%) and Nvidia (12.52%). Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia are all at the forefront of the AI revolution, while Amazon has become a dominant force in e-commerce.\nThat's impressive enough, but the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF doesn't stop there. Regarding weight allocation, every S&P 500 Magnificent Seven member is included in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's top ten. That means you'll also be investing in Meta and Tesla. The fund also holds shares in market share and sector powerhouses like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco and McDonalds.\nSee Also: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\nAll these companies offer products and services in high demand from large segments of the buying public. They also have a level of global recognition that is difficult to overestimate. According to Ycharts, the combined market cap of the S&P 500 Magnificent Seven is over $16 trillion. Ycharts data also shows that Magnificent Seven heavyweights Google, Nvidia and Microsoft are up by nearly 50% in 2024.\nThe same data also reveals the Magnificent Seven stocks have been responsible for 64.1% of the S&P 500's market cap growth for the year. So, when you buy into the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, you buy shares in multiple companies that have grown rapidly throughout 2024. They also look set for continued growth in 2025 and beyond.\nStory Continues\nTrying to buy individual shares in these companies would be cost-prohibitive for all but the most successful everyday investors. However, you can buy Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF shares for $350.36 (according to Vanguard website). Vanguard's public filings also indicate that the Mega Cap Growth ETF has increased in value by an incredible 35% in 2024.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nThe 10-year return (per Vanguard) is an impressive 16.30%, meaning this ETF also has potential as a buy-and-hold investment that can grow your wealth significantly. Although this ETF focuses more on growth than passive income, it currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.374 per share. It's easy to see the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's potential when you look at the total package.\nThe downside risk is that the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's continued performance is heavily tied to big tech's fortunes. The AI revolution is pushing companies like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia into the stratosphere regarding value, but nothing goes up forever. That's why even though this ETF is highly diversified, putting all your eggs in this one basket may not be wise.\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- The stock market\u2019s growth engine is running on fumes.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect\nNYC\u2019s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp\nKansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit\nFor years, investors have counted on the biggest technology companies to power equity indexes higher based on their strong earnings and expectations for even more profits in the future, most recently fueled by the development of artificial intelligence services. Those days appear to be over, at least for now. And it\u2019s forcing investors to think of other ways to play the latest equities bull market as it enters its third year.\nThe issue is profits. The Magnificent Seven tech giants \u2014 Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. \u2014 are expected to post a combined earnings increase of 18% in 2025, down from a projected 34% for 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Strip out Nvidia, arguably the biggest beneficiary of Wall Street\u2019s AI mania, the rest of the group is expected to post a measly 3% increase in profits in 2025.\nAn 18% profit expansion is good news for just about any sector \u2014 but Big Tech. Should the estimate come to fruition, the high-flying cohort will fall behind health care in full-year earnings growth and not significantly above the materials and industrials groups.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 Index\u2019s earnings growth is projected to reach 13% in 2025, up from 10% this year. In other words, the tech giants are no longer setting the pace for Corporate America.\n\u201cThe Mag Seven is not necessarily going to be the engine of growth for the market that it has been for the last year or so,\u201d said Julian McManus, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.\nLeaving Tech\nInvestors are already responding. In the week through Dec. 4, the information technology group had its largest outflow in six weeks at $1.4 billion, according a Bank of America note on Friday citing data from EPFR Global. Small-cap stocks, which have been trailing the broader market this year, had $4.6 billion of inflows, putting them at an annualized record high of more than $30 billion.\nMcManus said he\u2019s watching for upside surprises in free cash flow growth and sees alternatives to Big Tech all over the world, not just in the US, where he\u2019s \u201csignificantly underweight.\u201d He likes energy producers, which are benefiting from power-thirsty data centers and are a popular play, and sees opportunities in biotech as well as chip design software companies like Cadence Design Systems Inc.\nStory Continues\nA big part of the search for Big Tech alternatives is purely about their stock prices. Just this week, the Magnificent Seven companies traded at 41 times projected earnings, the highest valuation multiple since early 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The entire S&P 500 has seen a jump as well, with its ratio of 23 times the highest since 2021. But it\u2019s still almost half the price of the tech giants\u2019 valuations.\n\u201cYou\u2019re being overly risky being in just the megacaps,\u201d said Phil Blancato, chief executive officer at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at companies that are trading at valuations that are quite rich. Some of the numbers for the rest of the S&P 500 don\u2019t look bad, they look good. I\u2019d rather buy the rest of the S&P 500 at 18 times (forward earnings) versus the entire S&P 500 at 23 or 24 times.\u201d\nHe isn\u2019t alone in his skepticism. Wall Street pros like Michael Wilson, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, and Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, also see the equities rally continuing to broaden to sectors beyond Big Tech, a trend that began in the second half of the year.\n\u201cEuphoria around megacap tech is evident in growth expectations for the Magnificent 7 approaching all-time highs, just when their earnings are slated to decelerate,\u201d Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a note to clients this week. With the cohort accounting for about a third of the S&P 500\u2019s weighting, \u201cwe see more opportunity in the average stock than in the index,\u201d the strategists wrote.\nMagnificent One\nHowever, that isn\u2019t to say all Magnificent Seven stocks are created equal. Because there\u2019s one company that stands head and shoulders above the rest: Nvidia.\nRelentless demand for its accelerators used in AI computing has sent earnings soaring. Nvidia is projected to deliver $71 billion in profits on revenue of $129 billion next year, up 49% and 52%, respectively, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This explains why the stock is the seventh best performer in the Russell 1000 Index this year with a 193% gain \u2014 and the only Magnificent Seven company in the top 50.\nMuch of Nvidia\u2019s success is being driven by spending from its megacap peers. Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms are projected to show more than $200 billion in combined 2024 capital spending to beef up computing capacity. And they\u2019ve pledged to spend significantly more next year. That\u2019s great for Nvidia, but investors are questioning when those investments will pay off for the rest.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the Mag Seven sort of break up because gravity is going to catch up,\u201d Janus Henderson\u2019s McManus said.\nOf course, Wall Street has underestimated Big Tech\u2019s strength in the past. At the start of 2024, analysts were projecting earnings growth of 19% for the Magnificent Seven, and the group is now on track for a 34% increase.\nAnd despite the numbers, the tech giants still retain their allure with investors, especially if the economy deteriorates. Scott Chronert, US equity strategist at Citigroup, likens the group to a defensive sector like consumer staples, whose products people need regardless of economic circumstances. The point being, megacaps remain a safe bet in uncertain times \u2014 like now.\n\u201cIf you were to sell big tech, where would you go?\u201d said Andrew Choi, portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments. \u201cDo you really want to bet on rate-sensitive stocks where you need rates to go a certain direction? Do you want to chase places that have done well? Big tech remains the best, easiest answer for what you want regardless of what market conditions end up being.\u201d\n--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDubai\u2019s Alleged Crypto Scams Are Raking in Billions\nThe Quest to Turn Human Waste Into Medicine\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy.\nAQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998,\u00a0 dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology.\nCliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum.\nAsness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable.\nAQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility.\nStory Continues\nAQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments.\n\"We let the machine decide more,\"\nAsness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition.\nOur Methodology:\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is Supposedly Launching Its Next Major Gemini 2.0 Model, Set for December Release\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nPosition size: $583 million\nActivity: -23%\nAt the end of the first quarter AQR had more than $750 million invested in GOOGL stock when the stock was trading at $150. We wrote the following at the time:\n\"Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), is highly rated by analysts as a \"Strong Buy\" with an average price target of $191.83. This bullish stance is supported by expected growth in the advertising sector and accelerated U.S. eCommerce expansion, justifying a 26x multiple on Alphabet's next twelve months (NTM) earnings per share (EPS). In Q1 2024, 222 hedge funds held stakes in Alphabet, with Fisher Asset Management holding the largest at $6.9 billion. Alphabet\u2019s forward P/E ratio is 22.94, close to the S&P 500\u2019s 21, and its shares have gained 158% over four years, with revenue growing by 68%.\"\nGOOGL stock returned around 16% since then and AQR decided to trim its position by more than 20%. Overall AQR owns only 0.03% of GOOGL's outstanding shares. AQR also had $465 million invested in GOOG stock at the end of the third quarter, so overall AQR's Alphabet exposure is more than a billion dollars. GOOGL stock is exposed to two main risks. First, the regulators are trying to break up the company. Second, start-up AI companies like OpenAI, Perplexity are trying to change how consumers search for information.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 8th on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other tech stocks.\nIn a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment.\nMethodology\nWe first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is Supposedly Launching Its Next Major Gemini 2.0 Model, Set for December Release\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a leading technology company, encompassing a diverse portfolio of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo. In the third quarter of 2024, its performance was driven by the increasing demand for its search and cloud services, driven by advancements in AI.\nRecently, it has made notable improvements in its AI capabilities, particularly in enhancing search functionality by expanding the range of questions users can pose. Additionally, the company announced that new Chromebooks would feature built-in AI functionalities, further integrating advanced technology into everyday consumer products. On the shopping front, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) launched a new AI tool designed to assist consumers in selecting products by providing detailed information and recommendations.\nThe company's CEO has highlighted that AI solutions are driving deeper product adoption among existing customers while attracting new clients and securing larger contracts. This momentum is indicative of Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) strategic investments in AI infrastructure and its commitment to leveraging technology to gain a competitive advantage.\nGreensKeeper Asset Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was our largest detractor this quarter, declining by -8.8%. Global antitrust pressures have intensified, with the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission targeting several dominant technology companies, including Alphabet. Historically, Alphabet has signed agreements with Apple to serve as the exclusive default search engine for the Safari browser\u2014a practice that a US court recently ruled violated antitrust law. Despite the growing possibility that Alphabet will be required to end its exclusive distribution agreements with Apple, we believe that when faced with a choice screen, the vast majority of users will continue to select Google as their preferred search engine due to its quality advantage over competitors. In EU countries where Google was previously compelled to terminate similar agreements, 97% of users opted to retain Google as their default search engine when given a choice. A similar outcome in the United States would likely have an immaterial impact on GOOGL\u2019s earnings power. Alphabet is also facing other regulatory cases, which we monitor closely.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The law doesn\u2019t specifically ban TikTok but blocks app stores like Apple\u2019s (AAPL) App Store or Google's (GOOG) Play Store from distributing it unless ByteDance divests itself from the social network.\nWhile the decision is a setback for TikTok, it\u2019s not the end of the story. ByteDance is expected to appeal the law to the Supreme Court, which will make the ultimate call on the matter. If the law ultimately moves forward, it would be a huge blow to TikTok content creators, advertisers, and the app\u2019s 170 million users.\nBut one company will undeniably benefit from a TikTok ban: Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta (META).\n\u2022 USD\n(META)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nThe tech giant is not only TikTok\u2019s largest competitor but also the closest mainstream social media app with a similar user base and feature set. Meta designed Reels, which Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked up during the company\u2019s earnings calls, as a means of combating the rise of TikTok.\nInstagram introduced Reels in 2020, positioning it as a way for users to explore more of the content available on the photo- and video-sharing app. Since then, Meta has used AI to further tweak its recommendation feed, making Reels ever more compelling and ensuring users not only try out the feature but continue to scroll through video after video, just as they do on TikTok.\nMark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta, speaks during an appearance at SIGGRAPH 2024. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe moves are paying off too. During Meta\u2019s Q1 earnings call in April, Zuckerberg said that Reels usage makes up 50% of the time users spend on Instagram. And during the company\u2019s Q3 earnings call in October, CFO Susan Li said that 60% of Reels\u2019 recommendations come from original content, which is exactly what gets people to stick around and keep scrolling.\nMeta doesn\u2019t break out exactly how much revenue Reels contributes to the company\u2019s bottom line, but Li previously stated that the feature is a positive contributor to Meta\u2019s overall revenue.\nWith Reels performing well, TikTok content creators will likely move over to the service if their app of choice is ultimately banned in the US. Users that follow those creators would then follow suit and advertisers along with them, ultimately helping to boost Meta\u2019s revenue.\nShares of Meta jumped 2% Friday.\nMeta certainly isn\u2019t the only TikTok rival that could benefit if the app is banned. YouTube Shorts could also get a boost, which would similarly bring more advertising dollars to the Google-owned (GOOG, GOOGL) short-form video service.\nThe TikTok ban law spawned out of national security concerns related to the company\u2019s parent company ByteDance and its ties to the Chinese government. US officials fear that the Chinese government could force TikTok to spy on American users or use the app to spread pro-China propaganda.\nStory Continues\nTikTok has denied the accusations, and the US hasn\u2019t provided any direct evidence that the Chinese government is actively using the app to surveil its user base.\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped members of Congress from taking action. The battle over TikTok is now likely headed to the Supreme Court. There's also the outside chance that President-elect Trump could intervene on TikTok's behalf.\nWhile Trump originally initiated moves to ban the social media app, he's since softened his stance on the platform.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. \u00b7 yahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

TikTok and ByteDance had argued that the law is unconstitutional and violates Americans' free speech rights.\nIn an email to advertisers on Friday, which was seen by Reuters, TikTok's president of global business solutions Blake Chandlee said the company planned to seek \"an injunction to stop the TikTok ban from going into effect until the U.S. Supreme Court has an opportunity to review it.\"\nWith TikTok's future in the U.S. uncertain, advertising executives said brands are maintaining their activities on the app, while ensuring they have a plan B.\n\"Advertisers have not pulled back from TikTok, though several are developing contingency plans for potential reallocation of investment should there be a ban,\" said Jason Lee, executive vice president of brand safety at media agency Horizon Media.\nHorizon is working with clients to prepare for a variety of scenarios if the app is sold or banned, Lee said.\nMeta Platforms, owner of Facebook and Instagram, stands to gain the majority of TikTok's ad revenue if the app is banned, followed by Alphabet's YouTube, said Erik Huberman, CEO of marketing agency Hawke Media. Both companies have introduced short-form video features in the past few years to compete with TikTok.\nStill, \"there's no decision to make until there's a decision to make,\" he said.\nThe app continues to have an active audience, making it unlikely for brands to step away prematurely. \"At the end of the day, advertisers won't abandon the ship unless their customers do first,\" said Lance Wolder, head of strategy at digital advertising firm PadSquad.\nTikTok's U.S. ad revenue is expected to reach $12.3 billion this year, according to estimates from research firm Emarketer. By comparison, analysts on average expect Meta Platforms' advertising revenue in 2024 to reach about $159 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\"The loss of TikTok in the U.S. would cause a major shakeup in the social landscape, benefiting Meta, YouTube and Snap, while hurting content creators and small businesses who rely on the app to make a living,\" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer.\nStory Continues\nThe potential boon for rivals propelled stocks on Friday.\nMeta Platforms shares rose to an all-time record high of $629.78 earlier on Friday, and were up 2.3% at $622.85 in late afternoon regular trading.\nAlphabet shares were up 1.1% at $176.21. Trump Media & Technology, which operates the Truth Social app and is majority-owned by President-elect Donald Trump, rose 3% to $34.78. Shares of Snap, owner of messaging app Snapchat, rose 1.89% to $12.40.\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York and Sheila Dang in Austin; Editing by Bill Berkrot and Shri Navaratnam)\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other AI news and ratings that Wall Street is watching.\nThe United States government recently announced fresh curbs targeting the chip industry in China. Per a report by news platform Al Jazeera, this is the third crackdown on American chip business with China in three years. The latest measures include curbing exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment maker Naura Technology Group, the report underlined. It added that the new rules also hit Chinese chip toolmakers Piotech, ACM Research, and SiCarrier Technology. According to the report, new export restrictions are part of the package, which also takes aim at shipments of advanced memory chips and chips tools to China.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nThe updated sanctions package includes curbs on China-bound shipments of high bandwidth memory chips. These chips are critical for high-end applications like AI training. The US has also introduced export curbs on chip making equipment made in countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. Through these measures, introduced just a few days before President-elect Donald Trump takes charge at the White House, the US aims to limit Chinese access to chips that can help advance artificial intelligence for military applications, or otherwise threaten US national security.\nREAD ALSO: 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "Ride-hailing stalwart Uber (UBER) is in focus this week, as robotaxi challenges from Waymo and others may cut into its future prospects. But Uber has its own autonomous vehicle (AV) ambitions, making the competitive landscape a crowded one that could ultimately benefit Uber.\nOn Friday, Uber said it would partner with robotaxi maker WeRide (WRD) to launch ride-hailing in Abu Dhabi. Uber said it would be the first time AVs are available on the Uber platform outside of the US and that Abu Dhabi would be the largest commercial robotaxi service outside the US and China when it launches in 2025.\nUber stock is slightly higher today on the news, but it slid 10% on Thursday when autonomous rideshare firm Waymo, backed by Alphabet (GOOGL), said it would expand its robotaxi service to Miami, Fla. Waymo has previously tested vehicles in Miami, the company said, a city that provided \u201cchallenging rainy conditions\u201d for its driverless vehicles.\n\u2022 USD\n(UBER)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nWaymo said it is already providing 150,000 trips per week in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin.\nUber, which relies on human drivers for its ride-hailing, could possibly be threatened by the rise of robotaxi operators, which would have better margins since there would be no human drivers to pay.\nUber is no stranger to robotaxi initiatives. The company expanded a \u201cmultiyear strategic partnership\u201d with Waymo, of all companies, to bring autonomous ride-hailing to Austin and Atlanta using the Uber platform. In addition to its partnership with WeRide in Abu Dhabi, Uber has strategic partnerships with GM\u2019s Cruise, delivery company Coco, and AV tech firms Wayve and Avride.\nAV and robotaxi tech development is an expensive and oftentimes challenging business. Uber itself sold off its autonomous unit to Aurora back in 2020 before striking partnerships recently with AV providers like Waymo and Cruise. In late 2022, Ford and Volkswagen pulled the plug on startup Argo AI, claiming AVs and robotaxis were too expensive and difficult to roll out to market, with both companies looking to focus on driver assistance technology instead.\nUber and WeRide launch autonomous mobility service in Abu Dhabi (Photo: Business Wire) \u00b7 Business Wire\nWhile Uber stock took a hit on Thursday due to Waymo\u2019s latest move to Miami, not all of Wall Street is convinced the Waymo threat is a death knell to Uber\u2019s business.\n\u201cWhile the prospect of greater Waymo competition in 2026 is a sentiment overhang, Waymo operating independently in some cities is not new news,\u201d BofA analyst John Murphy wrote in a note to investors on Friday.\nWhat is most intriguing, Murphy wrote, is that Uber could be a \u201clong-term beneficiary\u201d of growing AV competitors.\nStory Continues\nTesla, a wild card in the robotaxi space because of its improving self-driving tech and ability to manufacture its own vehicles, could be a \u201cwake up call\u201d for the industry, Murphy said. However, Uber\u2019s brand is well-entrenched in many cities, and Murphy believes this makes the ride-hailing giant, which has 161 million monthly active users, an attractive one for other AV providers.\nThe move in Uber\u2019s stock on Thursday was \u201coverdone,\u201d Murphy and BofA surmised, with the stock today at \u201cattractive\u201d levels. BofA has a Buy rating on Uber and $93 price target, suggesting upside of over 40%.\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Its Gemini models are currently used by more than 2 billion users monthly across products and platforms. Gemini comes in four sizes, forming a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything, from data centers to devices.\n\nGOOGL continues to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure to support its AI efforts globally. It is leveraging AI to improve the coding process, and more than 25% of all new code at Google is currently generated by AI.\n\nThe integration of GenAI technology into the search engine is benefiting Google Search. Large Language Models, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are continuously improving the search results.\n\nNew AI-powered enhancements, such as AI Overview, Circle to Search and advanced features in Lens, are improving user experience. AI Overview currently reaches more than 1 billion users monthly, and engagement levels are quite strong. The integration of ads within AI Overviews bodes well for Alphabet\u2019s monetization efforts.\n\nCircle to Search is now available on more than 150 million Android devices, with people using it to shop, translate text and learn more about the world around them. Lens has become the fastest-growing query type due to its ability to help in product discovery and shopping.\n\nAlphabet is leveraging AI and Generative AI (Gen AI) to boost Pixel\u2019s features. The devices run on Google Tensor G4 chips, which help bring the Gemini Nano with Multimodality, Google\u2019s latest on-device AI model. Gemini assistant understands text, as well as images, audio and speech due to the multimodal models.\n\nGoogle Tensor G4 is custom-built for Gemini and helps users browse the web 20% faster and launch apps 17% faster on average.\n\nAI and Gen AI power Pixel\u2019s photography and video capabilities, including Add Me and Plus Magic Editor features. Pixel Weather app uses AI to offer more accurate forecasts. Users can create lists in Google Keep with the help of Gemini. Call Assist uses AI to not only screen spam calls but also to wait on hold for users. This feature is now available on Pixel Watch 3.\nStory Continues\nAI Helping GOOGL Maintain Competitive Prowess\nIn the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market, Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider compared with Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud arm, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft MSFT Azure.\n\nAlphabet is seeing strong demand due to an innovative AI infrastructure. GOOGL offers customers a range of AI accelerator options, including multiple classes of NVIDIA NVDA GPUs and custom-built TPUs.\n\nEnterprise AI platform Vertex is gaining rapid adoption. Enterprises are combining Alphabet\u2019s AI platform with data platform BigQuery to make accurate real-time decisions. BigQuery machine learning operation saw 80% growth over the past six months, driven by this strong demand.\n\nHowever, stiff competition in the cloud and AI domains has negatively affected Alphabet\u2019s stock price. GOOGL shares have returned 26.1% in the past 12 months, underperforming both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Internet Services industry. Over the same timeframe, the sector and industry have returned 37.7% and 26.8%, respectively.\nGOOGL\u2019s Past 12-Month Performance\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Trend Higher for GOOGL\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $294.74 billion, indicating 14.91% growth over 2023\u2019s reported figure.\n\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $8.02 per share, up a couple of cents over the past 30 days, suggesting 38.28% growth from the figure reported in 2023.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.84%.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market and strong position in the cloud are long-term drivers.\n\nAlphabet is facing increasing regulatory headwinds and global scrutiny over its search dominance. Google\u2019s alleged wrong practices constitute the utilization of Android to promote its own search engine unfairly. It is facing several lawsuits regarding data privacy, competition practices, AI usage, and copyright issues in several countries across the globe.\n\nAlphabet continues to face rigorous scrutiny and any scenario involving a forced breakup by the U.S. government can have serious repercussions over its prospects. Moreover, stiff competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon is a headwind.\n\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy.\nAQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998,\u00a0 dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology.\nCliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum.\nAsness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable.\nAQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility.\nStory Continues\nAQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments.\n\"We let the machine decide more,\"\nAsness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition.\nOur Methodology:\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nPosition size: $1.73 billion\nActivity: 5%\nMicrosoft (MSFT) was the #1 position in AQR's portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Here is what we said six months ago:\nAnalysts from Wolfe Research and Barclays believe that Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) is well-positioned amid expected market volatility, emphasizing its resilience and investor appeal. MSFT has seen significant share price gains by 30% over the past one year. Following which multiple Wall Street analysts support bullish sentiments in addition to New Street Research that gave the Company a new Buy rating with a $570 price target. The company's strategic integration of AI in its Cloud division has driven impressive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Microsoft's investments in its Search business, Bing, have also generated market share gains. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate continued earnings growth for MSFT, making its current valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of 31, attractive.\"\nAt the time AQR had $1.67 billion invested in the stock and MSFT shares were trading at $421. MSFT stock only returned 5% since then and it isn't the top position in AQR's portfolio anymore. Overall, AQR owns only 0.05% of MSFT's outstanding shares. This may be a top 3 position for AQR but relatively AQR isn't too bullish on the stock.\nOverall MSFT ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Regarding weight allocation, every S&P 500 Magnificent Seven member is included in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's top ten. That means you'll also be investing in Meta and Tesla. The fund also holds shares in market share and sector powerhouses like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco and McDonalds.\nSee Also: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\nAll these companies offer products and services in high demand from large segments of the buying public. They also have a level of global recognition that is difficult to overestimate. According to Ycharts, the combined market cap of the S&P 500 Magnificent Seven is over $16 trillion. Ycharts data also shows that Magnificent Seven heavyweights Google, Nvidia and Microsoft are up by nearly 50% in 2024.\nThe same data also reveals the Magnificent Seven stocks have been responsible for 64.1% of the S&P 500's market cap growth for the year. So, when you buy into the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, you buy shares in multiple companies that have grown rapidly throughout 2024. They also look set for continued growth in 2025 and beyond.\nStory Continues\nTrying to buy individual shares in these companies would be cost-prohibitive for all but the most successful everyday investors. However, you can buy Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF shares for $350.36 (according to Vanguard website). Vanguard's public filings also indicate that the Mega Cap Growth ETF has increased in value by an incredible 35% in 2024.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nThe 10-year return (per Vanguard) is an impressive 16.30%, meaning this ETF also has potential as a buy-and-hold investment that can grow your wealth significantly. Although this ETF focuses more on growth than passive income, it currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.374 per share. It's easy to see the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's potential when you look at the total package.\nThe downside risk is that the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's continued performance is heavily tied to big tech's fortunes. The AI revolution is pushing companies like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia into the stratosphere regarding value, but nothing goes up forever. That's why even though this ETF is highly diversified, putting all your eggs in this one basket may not be wise.\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

(NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other tech stocks.\nIn a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment.\nMethodology\nWe first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology giant that is well-known for its impactful technologies and has recently made significant strides in the AI landscape. In November, it launched new and improved AI models designed to cater to various industries, enhancing its offerings through the Azure AI model catalog.\nRecent reports indicate that the company's investments in AI are beginning to yield positive results. In FQ1 2025, which ended on September 30, the company reported $65.6 billion in revenue, reflecting a 16% increase year-over-year. This was driven by a record quarterly revenue of $38.9 billion from its cloud services, a 22% increase year-over-year. The Azure segment alone achieved a remarkable 33% growth in revenue, due to high demand for AI-driven solutions within its cloud offerings.\nThese developments highlight the effectiveness of its strategy in harnessing AI to boost business outcomes. The company revealed plans to build 3 trusted platforms focused on maximizing the benefits of AI for the business, demonstrating its approach to integrating AI into core business functions.\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is at the forefront of AI innovation, with a clear focus on expanding its capabilities through partnerships and product enhancements. It is positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for AI solutions across various sectors, reinforcing its status as a leader in the technology industry.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $147 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. Shares gave back some gains from strong performance over the first half of this year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported a strong quarter with total revenue growing 16%, in line with the Street; Microsoft Cloud up 22%; Azure up 30%; 43% operating income margins; and 36% free cash flow margins. Core Azure growth came in one point shy of expectations, however, due to a soft European market and continued constraints on AI compute capacity. In the same vein, while Microsoft reiterated its fiscal 2025 targets of double-digit top-line and operating income growth, quarterly guidance called for Azure growth to slow a bit before accelerating in the back half of the fiscal year, as capital expenditures increase, yielding an expansion of AI compute capacity. We believe this investment is a leading indicator for growth, with more than half of the spend related to durable land and data center build outs, which should monetize over the next 15-plus years. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes, and we remain investors.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best beginner stocks to invest in now.\nThe Downsides to Stocks Rallying Higher\nStocks in the United States are rallying high, but some strategists are eyeing a few risks. On December 5, Max Kettner, Chief Multi-Asset Strategist at HSBC, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the market outlook heading into 2025. Kettner shared that investors and analysts alike hold extremely bullish expectations of the market in 2025. While that may likely be true, an extremely bullish market may pose a significant risk and have multiple downsides.\nHe stated that the market will likely see strong upsides on the earnings front, leading to higher yields, which will leave a question on the future of the cutting cycle and whether the Fed will have to commence a rate hike again. He emphasized that higher terminal rates will bring in bond volatility and impact nearly every risk asset in the market.\nSpeaking of positives, Kettner highlighted that the next few quarters exhibit pretty low growth expectations and earnings expectations for the S&P. He reiterated that with a much lower growth rate, the cutting cycle will be executed as planned. As for inflation, he highlighted the importance of super core inflation, also referred to as underlying inflation. He believes super core inflation is more likely to decline, especially in the first half of the year, adding that he is not as worried about inflation as he was almost three to four months ago.\nKettner stated that the next six to seven months will deliver a supportive market environment for equities in the S&P, especially for global equities. He also believes that the market will see a 12% to 13% upside in the next 12 months until the end of 2025. While Kettner remained inclined to tech stocks, he added that other sectors, such as industrials, will also see a \u201cmini re-acceleration.\u201d\nHe emphasized that the market rally will go beyond the S&P especially with the current \u201cgoldilocks\u201d backdrop, high growth projections, and consensus expectations, benefiting other asset classes. Kettner shared that the ideal portfolio for investors will be tech stocks and a combination of stocks in other sectors, especially industrials and US banks. He added that these sectors are likely to benefit from regulatory changes and the current economic backdrop.\nAs economic and political turmoil encapsulates the market, some stocks have been performing consistently well over the years, positioned as solid investments, especially for new investors. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 11 best beginner stocks to invest in now.\nStory Continues\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 11 best beginner stocks to invest in now, we compiled a list of the top blue chip stocks. We then tracked the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Over the past few months, the company has accelerated its position on the innovation front through strong partnerships and new product releases, reflecting its position in the tech sector. Recently, the company partnered with Accenture and Avanade to help businesses transform their functions using artificial intelligence and Microsoft Copilot. In addition to that, the company also launched new and improved adapted AI models for various industries. The new models will help organizations address their particular AI needs with greater efficacy and will readily be available through the Azure AI model catalog.\nThese partnerships and advancements helped Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) report solid financial results, giving it a strong head start to the fiscal year 2025. In the fiscal first quarter of 2025, the company logged $65.5 billion in revenue, up by 16% year-over-year, and $24.7 billion in net income, up by 11% from the same quarter last year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) attributes its performance to its AI-backed transformation, resulting in improved workflow, operational efficiencies, and happy customers.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a sustainable business model, especially due to its subscription-based productivity suite which has been growing. Revenue for its productivity and business processes segment grew by 12% to reach $28.3 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2025. Its star product, Microsoft 365 (commercial products and cloud services), saw a 12% increase in revenue during the same period.

Shares have added about 5.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PTC Inc. due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nPTC's Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates\nPTC reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.54, up 28% year over year.

It plans to buy back nearly $300 million of its stock in fiscal 2025, with purchases commencing in the fiscal first quarter. In addition, PTC intends to retire $500 million in senior notes due in the fiscal second quarter of 2025.\nTop Line Details\nRecurring revenues of $582.4 million rose 16.4% year over year.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently.\nWith Trump taking in the reigns soon, steps toward overhauling the US policy have begun. President-elect Trump said on Thursday that he is appointing former Pay Pal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar\u201d.\n\u201cDavid will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas,\u201d\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nOfficials such as the crypto czar, a title that is not known to be official, along with other officials in Trump's incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are anticipated to reshape U.S. policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council. lad Gil, an entrepreneur, stated that the choice of Sacks is a \"strong move\" in a post on X. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also congratulated him.\nIn other news, OpenAI has debuted a \u201cresearch grade\u201d version of its main artificial intelligence (AI) model. The ChatGPT Pro is a $200-per-month plan that includes unlimited access to the company\u2019s smartest model, OpenAI o1, as well as to o1-mini, GPT-4o and Advanced Voice.\n\u201cAs AI becomes more advanced, it will solve increasingly complex and critical problems. It also takes significantly more compute to power these capabilities\u201d.\nChatGPT Pro also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute for thinking harder and provides even better answers to the hardest problems. OpenAI also expects to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan in the future. Moreover, the company announced that it is awarding 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions in the U.S. to help drive meaningful progress in fields that benefit humanity.\nArtificial intelligence is also shaping the healthcare industry. As per a recent study by Accenture, AI-driven healthcare has the potential to save up to $150 billion annually by 2026 in the US. \u00a0This is done by reducing administrative costs, automating patient education, and improving adherence to care plans. In particular, AI-powered assistants can provide essential, 24/7 support. In the latest news, researchers from Germany and the US have developed a deep learning framework for automated volumetric body composition analysis using whole-body MRI. Published in eBioMedicine, the study validated this approach and demonstrated its potential to predict all-cause mortality in a large Western population.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

According to Adobe Analytics, online spending has hit $10.8 billion in the US, and Generative AI chatbots drove a 1,800% surge in retail site traffic compared to 2023. These tools helped bargain hunters find deals, compare products, and check out more quickly.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nSimilarly, Salesforce revealed that the use of AI-enabled online chat services grew 31% year-on-year on Black Friday, with U.S. Black Friday online sales reaching $17.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Digital retailers using generative AI and agents in their customer service experiences saw a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those who did not.\nIn other news, OpenAI\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, told the Financial Times that the company is considering introducing ads on its platform. She further revealed that the company had recently hired Kevin Weil, an executive from Instagram, who was well-suited to the task.\n\u201cThe good news with Kevin Weil at the wheel with product is that he came from Instagram. He knows how this [introducing ads] works\u201d.\nHowever, a later statement issued by Friar reveals that while OpenAI may be open to the possibility, they currently don\u2019t have any active plans for the same.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re open to exploring other revenue streams in the future, we have no active plans to pursue advertising.\u201d\nA Bloomberg Opinion\u00a0column by Dave Lee\u00a0reveals that such an apparent change in statements could be because the AI Company realized that advertisements tend to signal \u201ctroubling trends\u201d. The shift may send doubts about the profitability of its subscription-based model, raising concerns about potential \u201censhittification\u201d, as tech commentator and activist Cory Doctorow famously terms it, where user-focused features are compromised for advertiser-driven engagement and time optimization.\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s endeavors are so huge that its revenues don\u2019t manage to cover them. The development of advanced AI models would require even greater spending, which is why advertising could be seen as an avenue to help bridge the gap. However, its risks undermine ChatGPT's appeal as an alternative to Google search, potentially disrupting its user experience, Lee\u00a0noted.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Let\u2019s take a look at CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhat Is CrowdStrike Holdings Worth?\nAccording to our valuation model, CrowdStrike Holdings seems to be fairly priced at around 9.2% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy CrowdStrike Holdings today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $385.27, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nWhat kind of growth will CrowdStrike Holdings generate?\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Earnings and Revenue Growth December 4th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. CrowdStrike Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in CRWD\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on CRWD, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing CrowdStrike Holdings at this point in time.

The latest country to embrace it is Japan. According to\u00a0The Japan Times,\u00a0private-sector businesses in the country have begun embracing related information technologies to enhance operational efficiency. GenAI search services, in particular, are proving\u00a0useful for searching corporate databases.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI News Updates This Weekend\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nThe news states how Lion, a leading Japanese consumer goods company, has built a generative AI-powered search system that allows its researchers to search through research reports and conference materials stored in the company\u2019s database efficiently.\n\u201cTo drive innovation, we need a system that allows researchers to have quick access to technical knowledge when they need it\u201d.\nYamaoka revealed that the time required to locate a desired document has been reduced to an average of one-fifth of that with conventional search systems. The company further states that GenAI is proving beneficial not only for recruits and young employees but also for those transitioning to new workplaces, allowing them to \u201csystematically acquire knowledge in unfamiliar fields\u201d. Even though GenAI comes with its fair share of challenges such as hallucinations and copyright concerns, it also stands to benefit the corporate world in the long run.\nIn other news, one popular AI chatbot is seemingly facing a technical glitch and preventing it from saying one name in particular: David Mayer. If there is one name in the AI realm that everyone knows about, it\u2019s ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence chatbot has been trained on large amounts of data to create content, including voices, music, pictures, and videos. However, it was recently unearthed by a Reddit user that the AI chatbot is unable to say David Mayer.\nAccording to AI expert Justine Moore, a plausible scenario is that someone named David Mayer went out of his way to remove his presence from the internet. For example, strict privacy laws in the European Union allow citizens to file \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +16%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 8.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -78.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +20.7%. This estimate has changed +10.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.36 indicates a change of +16.8% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +22.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.93 billion and $4.73 billion estimates indicate +28.5% and +20.4% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $1.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $982.26 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.84%. The EPS surprise was +14.81%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Have you evaluated the performance of CrowdStrike Holdings' (CRWD) international operations during the quarter that concluded in October 2024? Considering the extensive worldwide presence of this cloud-based security company, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial resilience and potential for growth.\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\nUpon examining CRWD's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\nFor the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $1.01 billion, experiencing an increase of 28.5% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of CRWD's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations.\nA Closer Look at CRWD's Revenue Streams Abroad\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa accounted for 15.90% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $160.57 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +2.08%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $157.3 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe, Middle East, and Africa contributed $148.85 million (15.44%) and $119.16 million (15.16%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Other International contributed $63.29 million in revenue, making up 6.27% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $62.13 million, this meant a surprise of +1.87%. Looking back, Other International contributed $61.75 million, or 6.41%, in the previous quarter, and $47.52 million, or 6.05%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nOf the total revenue, $102.84 million came from Asia Pacific during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 10.18%. This represented a surprise of -1.89% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $104.82 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $98.27 million, or 10.20%, and $81.46 million, or 10.36%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nStory Continues\nAnticipated Revenues in Overseas Markets\nIt is projected by analysts on Wall Street that CrowdStrike will post revenues of $1.03 billion for the ongoing fiscal quarter, an increase of 22.3% from the year-ago quarter. The expected contributions from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Other International and Asia Pacific to this revenue are 16.2%, 6.4% and 10.7%, translating into $167.41 million, $65.97 million and $110.85 million, respectively.\nFor the full year, the company is projected to achieve a total revenue of $3.93 billion, which signifies a rise of 28.5% from the last year. The share of this revenue from various regions is expected to be: Europe, Middle East, and Africa at 15.6% ($613.74 million), Other International at 6.2% ($242.11 million) and Asia Pacific at 10.4% ($407.54 million).\nKey Takeaways\nThe dependency of CrowdStrike on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\nIn an era of growing international ties and escalating geopolitical disputes, financial analysts on Wall Street pay keen attention to these developments to fine-tune their earnings estimations for businesses operating across borders. It's important to note, however, that a range of additional variables, like a company's local market status, also play a crucial role in shaping these forecasts.\nAt Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating mechanism, demonstrates a notable performance history confirmed through external audits. It effectively utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions to act as a predictor of a stock's price performance in the near term.\nCurrently, CrowdStrike holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signifying its potential to match the overall market's performance in the forthcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nExploring Recent Trends in CrowdStrike's Stock Price\nThe stock has witnessed an increase of 14.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's an increase of 3.5%. In the same interval, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has registered an increase of 0.1%. Over the past three months, the company's shares saw an increase of 40.4%, while the S&P 500 increased by 8.2%.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading cybersecurity software company. Following a long period of outsized gains, shares fell 29.5% in the quarter after a software glitch caused a global Microsoft outage in July. Despite the outage, the company delivered solid second quarter results that exceeded the high end of expectations across all key metrics. Management called out several delayed deals but noted that they remained in the pipeline and should close in coming quarters. Increased scrutiny and the implementation of new incentives, including discounts and free products and flexibility on billings, will likely negatively impact bookings and revenue growth over the near term. While the range of outcomes on the implications of the outage on customer retention and willingness to expand with CrowdStrike remains wider than usual, leading us to reduce our position, we believe that the fact that the incident was not due to a breach, the company\u2019s competitively advantaged product, its transparent and rapid response, and the new procedures it had put in place, should help it retain its customers and grow wallet share over time.\"\nBest Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently.\nWith Trump taking in the reigns soon, steps toward overhauling the US policy have begun. President-elect Trump said on Thursday that he is appointing former Pay Pal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar\u201d.\n\u201cDavid will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also congratulated him.\nIn other news, OpenAI has debuted a \u201cresearch grade\u201d version of its main artificial intelligence (AI) model. The ChatGPT Pro is a $200-per-month plan that includes unlimited access to the company\u2019s smartest model, OpenAI o1, as well as to o1-mini, GPT-4o and Advanced Voice.\n\u201cAs AI becomes more advanced, it will solve increasingly complex and critical problems. It also takes significantly more compute to power these capabilities\u201d.\nChatGPT Pro also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute for thinking harder and provides even better answers to the hardest problems. OpenAI also expects to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan in the future. Moreover, the company announced that it is awarding 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions in the U.S. to help drive meaningful progress in fields that benefit humanity.\nArtificial intelligence is also shaping the healthcare industry. As per a recent study by Accenture, AI-driven healthcare has the potential to save up to $150 billion annually by 2026 in the US. \u00a0This is done by reducing administrative costs, automating patient education, and improving adherence to care plans. In particular, AI-powered assistants can provide essential, 24/7 support.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other tech stocks.\nIn a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The technology is slated to be part of the iPhone SE, the company\u2019s entry-level smartphone, which will be updated next year for the first time since 2022.\nA modem is a critical piece of any mobile phone, letting the device connect to cell towers in order to make calls and link up with the internet. Apple\u2019s first version of the component will be followed by further generations that become increasingly more advanced. The company aims to ultimately overtake Qualcomm\u2019s technology by 2027, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project is confidential.\nApple\u2019s modem has been a long time coming. When the company set out to build the chip, it originally hoped to bring it to market as early as 2021. To jump-start the effort, the company invested billions of dollars to set up testing and engineering labs around the world. It also spent about $1 billion to acquire Intel Corp.\u2019s modem group and millions more hiring engineers from other silicon companies.\nOver the years, Apple encountered setback after setback. Early prototypes were too large, ran too hot and weren\u2019t power-efficient enough. There also were concerns internally that Apple was simply developing a modem to get back at Qualcomm, following a legal battle over licensing payments that didn\u2019t go the iPhone maker\u2019s way.\nBut after adjusting development practices, reorganizing management and hiring scores of new engineers from Qualcomm itself, Apple is now confident that its modem plan will work, the people said. It would be a major win for the company\u2019s hardware technologies team, which is run by Senior Vice President Johny Srouji.\nRepresentatives for Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment.\nQualcomm has long been preparing for Apple to switch away from its modems, but the company still receives more than 20% of its revenue from the iPhone maker, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its stock fell as much as 2% to a session low after Bloomberg News reported on Apple\u2019s plans Friday. It closed at $159.51 in New York trading, down less than 1%.\nStory Continues\nShares of Qorvo Inc., another component supplier at risk of being replaced by Apple\u2019s modem efforts, declined as much as 6% before recovering. Apple shares were little changed.\nWhen the iPhone SE debuts in a few months, it will have major new features, including Apple Intelligence and the edge-to-edge screen design already used in more upscale models. But its most impressive breakthrough won\u2019t be visible to consumers: the in-house modem, code-named Sinope.\nFor now, the modem won\u2019t be used in Apple\u2019s higher-end products. It\u2019s set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year, code-named D23, that features a far-thinner design than current models. The chip will also start rolling out as early as 2025 in Apple\u2019s lower-end iPads.\nIn preparation for the iPhone SE, Cupertino, California-based Apple has been secretly testing the new modem on hundreds of devices deployed to employees globally. And it has been doing quality assurance testing with its carrier partners around the world.\nThe company decided to start with lower-end products in part because a modem is a risky endeavor: If it doesn\u2019t work properly, customers will suffer dropped calls and missed notifications. There\u2019s little tolerance for that on Apple\u2019s highest-end, $1,000-plus iPhones.\nMoreover, Sinope isn\u2019t as advanced as the latest modems from San Diego-based Qualcomm, meaning the first Apple modem is a downgrade from the component currently in the iPhone 16 Pro.\nUnlike today\u2019s high-end Qualcomm parts, the Sinope modem won\u2019t support mmWave, a type of 5G technology used by Verizon Wireless and other carriers, primarily in major cities, that can theoretically handle download speeds of as much as 10 gigabits per second. Instead, the Apple component will rely on the Sub-6 standard, a more prevalent technology used by the current iPhone SE.\nThe first Apple modem will also only support four-carrier aggregation, a technology that combines bands from several wireless providers simultaneously to increase network capacity and speeds. Modems from Qualcomm can support six or more carriers at the same time.\nIn lab tests, the first Apple modem caps out at download speeds of about 4 gigabits per second, less than the top speeds offered by non-mmWave Qualcomm modems, the people said. Real world speeds for both types of modems are typically far less, meaning that customers might not notice a difference in day-to-day use.\nIn any case, the first Apple modem will have several other advantages that the company believes will give it an edge with consumers. For one, it will be tightly integrated with Apple-designed main processors to use less power, scan for cellular service more efficiently and better support on-device features for connecting to satellite networks.\nThe Apple modem will also be able to offer better performance relative to SAR limits because it will be managed intelligently via the main processor, the people said. SAR, or specific absorption rate, is a measure of the radio frequency absorbed by the body, and government agencies such as the US Federal Communications Commission regulate acceptable levels.\nApple is also planning to include support for DSDS, or dual SIM dual standby. That allows data connections on both SIM cards when a user is using two phone numbers for their device.\nThe new modem will be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the manufacturer of the main processors inside the iPhone, iPad, Mac and other Apple devices.\nTo help build its modem, Apple rapidly expanded its office space in San Diego and other parts of Southern California, looking to poach talent from Qualcomm. Executives involved in the modem\u2019s development believe that some of the resources and talent acquired from Intel in 2019 were inadequate, and that hiring from Qualcomm helped Apple overcome earlier setbacks.\nSome of the development work for the modems has also taken place in Cupertino and offices in Munich.\nThe modem will work with another new Apple component: a radio frequency front-end system, or RFFE, called Carpo that helps devices connect to cellular networks.\nThat part will also take away business from Qualcomm, and could eventually affect Qorvo as well. Today, Apple uses Skyworks Solutions Inc. and Broadcom Inc. for so-called RF filters \u2014 relationships that will continue. Apple and Broadcom extended their supply agreement in 2023.\nShares of Broadcom gained 5.3%, while Skyworks climbed 1.7%.\nIn 2026, Apple looks to get closer to Qualcomm\u2019s capabilities with its second-generation modem, which will start appearing in higher-end products. This chip, Ganymede, is expected to go into the iPhone 18 line that year, as well as upscale iPads by 2027\nThe big difference is that Ganymede will catch up to current Qualcomm modems by adding support for mmWave, download speeds of 6 gigabits per second, six-carrier aggregation when using Sub-6, and eight-carrier aggregation when using mmWave.\nIn 2027, Apple aims to roll out its third modem, code-named Prometheus. The company hopes to top Qualcomm with that component\u2019s performance and artificial intelligence features by that point. It will also build in support for next-generation satellite networks.\nFurther out, Apple is discussing merging its modem and main processor into a single component.\n(Update shares in shares starting in eighth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDubai\u2019s Alleged Crypto Scams Are Raking in Billions\nThe Quest to Turn Human Waste Into Medicine\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

(AVGO), which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nThis chipmaker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.59%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Broadcom Inc. Was expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share, but it reported $1.24 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.33%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.08 per share, while it actually produced $1.10 per share, a surprise of 1.85%.\nFor Broadcom Inc.Estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nBroadcom Inc. Currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.84%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on December 12, 2024.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nStory Continues\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

He has a more than 40% stake in the company, according to Business Insider. Forbes real-time billionaires list shows that Ellison is currently the third-richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $229.4bn.\nOracle shares climbed after the company posted better-than-expected results in September for its fiscal first quarter.\nAdjusted revenue of $13.31bn beat analyst forecasts of $13.26bn, while adjusted earnings of $1.39 came in ahead of estimates of $1.33.\nRead more: How will Trump's tariffs impact UK and EU trade?\nOracle also announced partnerships with fellow tech giants Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on the same day that the results were published.\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance at the time, Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead said that as AI becomes more of a priority, this data will be the company's biggest play.\n\"The biggest obstruction from enterprises going hardcore into AI is the data problem,\" he said. \"It's getting the data right. It's co-mingling the right data to give generative AI the right solutions without leaking confidential information.\"\nFor certain customers, Moorhead said this meant that \"Oracle is the place to go. So they will be the data broker for the generative AI age.\"\nStory continues\nIn its latest rating, investment bank Jefferies maintained a \"buy\" recommendation on Oracle's stock but raised its price target on the shares from $190 to $220.\n\u2022 USD\n(ORCL)\nFollow\nView quote details\nBroadcom (AVGO) \u2014 Reports fourth quarter earnings on Thursday 12 December\nChipmaker Broadcom's guidance in September for fourth quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company said it expected revenue to come in at $14bn in the final quarter, versus estimates of $14.13bn.\nHowever, revenue for the third quarter of $13.07bn was slightly better than the expected $13.03bn. Adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share also topped the $1.22 estimate.\nShares fell following the release of these results in September, though the stock has recovered and is up 53% year-to-date.\nAnalysts have remained bullish on the stock, with UBS (UBSG.SW) most recently keeping its \"buy\" rating on Broadcom shares, raising their price target from $170 to $200.\nRead more: Global chip stocks to consider as investments beyond Nvidia\nChip stocks have benefitted from strong demand amid the global race to invest in AI, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index, known as the SOX (^SOX), up 20% year-to-date.\nHowever, there has been some pressure on shares more recently amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China.\nThis week Chinese industry bodies said that companies domestically should be careful of buying US chips, saying that they were \"no longer safe\" and encouraging them to buy locally instead. This came after the US launched crackdowns on exports of chips to Chinese companies.\nThe rise in trade tensions is happening even before US president-elect Donald Trump has returned to office. Trump, who is due to return to the White House in January, has proposed wide-sweeping tariffs on countries, particularly China.\n\u2022 USD\n(AVGO)\nFollow\nView quote details\nIndustria de Diseno Textil, S.A.

They also forecast net income of \u20ac1.74bn, up 10% year-on-year.\nIn addition to how the company has been trading in November and December, the analysts said investors would also be looking for any discussion of the impact of potential US trade tariffs and whether \"increased visibility of collaborations is a deliberate strategy to help elevate the brand\".\n\u2022 USD\n(ITX.MC)\nFollow\nView quote details\nBritish American Tobacco (BATS.L) \u2014 Releases full-year trading update on Wednesday 11 December\nDespite increasing regulatory pushback on the sector, shares in British American Tobacco (BAT) are still up 29% year-to-date.\nShares rose on the back of BAT's interim results in July, in which the tobacco giant reported earnings per share of 169.3p for the first half.

That's based on a benchmark of \u20ac977m earnings before interest and tax for 2023.\nThe travel company said it had also seen a promising start to the winter season, as customers continued to prioritise spending on leisure experiences.\nRead more: Investors shift to US funds and tech in November amid lower interest rates\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said that the 25% growth TUI guided to in its trading update \"might even prove to be modest\".\n\"The markets and airlines segments have been flying high this summer, buoyed by strong bookings and rising average selling prices,\" he said. \"Encouragingly, that momentum seems to have carried into the winter season, with leisure spending still a top priority for consumers despite economic headwinds.\"\n\"Investors will be keen for more colour on how this trend is shaping up,\" he added. \"It\u2019ll also be interesting to see if the holiday experiences segment lives up to TUI's raised expectations.\u201d\nShares have seen some volatility throughout 2024 but are still up 20% year-to-date.\n\u2022 USD\n(TUI1.DE)\nFollow\nView quote details\nOther companies reporting next week include:\nMonday 9 December\nOracle (ORCL)\nToll Brothers (TOL)\nTuesday 10 December\nNCC (NCC.L)\nAshtead (AHT.L)\nThungela Resources (TGA.L)\nColruyt (COLR.BR)\nMetro AG (B4B.DE)\nAutozone (AZO)\nGameStop (GME)\nFerguson (FERG)\nWednesday 11 December\nCohort (CHRT.L)\nS&U (SUS.L)\nTUI (TUI1.DE)\nLennar (LEN)\nThursday 12 December\nRWS (RWS.L)\nDe La Rue (DLAR.L)\nNewRiver REIT (NRR.L)\nJabil (JBL)\nCostCo (COST)\nCiena (CIEN)\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\nRead more on stocks:\nUK house prices hit record high in November\nHow Apple, Amazon and Tesla did as Mag 7 release earnings results\nGlobal dividends hit record high but UK companies lag behind\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

Over the same timeframe, the sector and industry have returned 37.7% and 55.4%, respectively.\n\nAVGO is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. Broadcom\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst.\n\nStrong demand for Broadcom\u2019s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) earns a Zacks Rank #2 six days from its next quarterly earnings release on December 12, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.40 a share.\nBroadcom Inc.'s Earnings ESP sits at 0.84%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.40 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39.\nAVGO is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Okta (OKTA) as well.\nOkta is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 26, 2025. OKTA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.71 a share 82 days from its next earnings release.\nFor Okta, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.69 is 3.11%.\nAVGO and OKTA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\nBroadcom Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\nThe President, Hock Tan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$26m worth of shares at a price of US$173 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$170. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\nBroadcom insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Insider Trading Volume December 6th 2024\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\nBroadcom Insiders Are Selling The Stock\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Broadcom. In total, insiders dumped US$60m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nInsider Ownership\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Broadcom insiders own 1.3% of the company, currently worth about US$10b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Broadcom Insiders?\nInsiders haven't bought Broadcom stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Broadcom.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss.\nDuring an appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box Europe, Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, discussed the outlook for the artificial intelligence industry and regulation in the United States with Donald Trump set to become president.\nWhen asked if there is a bit of a gold rush regarding AI, Calkins agreed. He said that AI comes with significant concerns, particularly among CEOs. This is because AI has the potential to embarrass organizations or compromise sensitive data, which creates hesitation. \u201cWe are all looking for a safe way to take the first step with AI,\u201d he said.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nRegarding whether companies are panicking about using AI profitably, Calkins observed a cautious approach from most businesses, while large tech firms have been investing aggressively. \u201cIt\u2019s a calculated risk, and they should be doing it,\u201d he said, contrasting this with the restraint shown by smaller companies.\nTalking about regulation, Calkins revealed that the bottom line is that AI can be somewhat dangerous if misused, which underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks. He referenced the European AI Act as an example, explaining that regulation could focus on restricting how AI is used or limiting the types of data it can access.\nWith the Trump administration coming in, Calkins predicted a strong focus on competing with China in the tech space. He also mentioned Elon Musk\u2019s influence on Trump, stating that Musk\u2019s influence on the Trump administration is positive because he knows deeply about artificial intelligence.\nIn other recent news, Sam Altman has announced a special event titled \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d. Altman will be revealing a new model or feature every weekday for two weeks, posted Altman on X, formerly Twitter. Some new models and features that users have been predicting include AI video generator Sora, the complete version of the \"o1\" reasoning model, and better control over ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice feature.\n\u201cEach weekday, we will have a livestream with a launch or demo, some big ones and some stocking stuffers\u201d.\nWith OpenAI seemingly in holiday spirits, the series of reveals will be live-streamed starting December 5, continuing for the next twelve weekdays. It looks like a very merry Christmas for all the tech fans.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets. On December 4th, HSBC analysts initiated coverage of chipmaker Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a \u201cHold\u201d rating and a price target of $160 per share. The rating initiation comes from Broadcom\u2019s increasing revenue exposure from artificial intelligence. As of Q3 2024, the company saw its revenues rise 47% to $13.1 billion, fueled by strong demand for AI semiconductor solutions and VMware.\nThe analysts told investors in a research note that Broadcom\u2019s valuation has risen significantly, now trading at 27 times its estimated earnings for fiscal 2025, compared to 18 times previously. However, the firm believes there is no room for further upside since the stock is already trading at a higher valuation than its competitors Nvidia and AMD. This is why the firm sees a less attractive risk/reward for Broadcom.\nOverall AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Despite these hefty expenditures, Big Tech has been enjoying solid revenues and earnings growth. Yung-Yu Ma, CIO at BMO Wealth Management, recently joined\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to shed light on the overall AI sector outlook heading into 2024.\nMa believes that companies are increasing their investments in AI in anticipation of higher returns. He said that it makes sense that the market is less likely to be enthusiastic about this situation. Ma argued that while spending on AI is likely to increase, there is a certainty that the results will soon show, maybe by the end of 2025.\nHe added that the market will probably see healthy earnings growth in 2025. Spending is broadly going to drive these earnings, particularly AI and its different use cases such as data centers, electricity grids, and other infrastructure. He expects an overall growth in valuation and shared that Big Tech is extremely confident and committed to pouring investment into the sector.\nA Glance at Some Revolutionary AI Startups\n2024 has been quite a year for artificial intelligence. Existing startups like Anthropic and Databricks have been performing exceptionally well and transforming the industry.\nAnthropic is an AI safety and research company behind the OpenAI rival, Claude. On November 24, Anthropic extended its partnership with AWS, involving another $4 billion investment, bringing the total to $8 billion. The partnership also positions AWS as Anthropic\u2019s primary cloud and training partner. Keeping up with the partnership, on December 4, Anthropic began optimizing Claude models to be able to run on AWS Trainium 2.\nDatabricks, the data and AI company, is another AI startup crucial to the AI revolution. Some of the products by Databricks include data management solutions, data warehousing, real-time analytics, data sharing, and data governance. The company is expanding to new heights. On November 6, the company partnered with KT Corporation to boost data and AI innovation in Korea. Following the trend, on November 20, Databricks announced it saw 70% annualized growth in its French business and has launched a new office in central Paris.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with AI stocks that will skyrocket, we consulted media reports to shortlist stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well according to analysts and strategists.

          "whole_article": "Broadcom Inc.\nCombination of 3D silicon stacking and 2.5D packaging technology enables custom compute platforms with breakthrough performance, power and cost\nPALO ALTO, Calif., Dec. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced the availability of its 3.5D eXtreme Dimension System in Package (XDSiP\u2122) platform technology, enabling consumer AI customers to develop next-generation custom accelerators (XPUs). The 3.5D XDSiP integrates more than 6000 mm2 of silicon and up to 12 high bandwidth memory (HBM) stacks in one packaged device to enable high-efficiency, low-power computing for AI at scale. Broadcom has achieved a significant milestone by developing and launching the industry's first Face-to-Face (F2F) 3.5D XPU.\nThe immense computational power required for training generative AI models relies on massive clusters of 100,000 growing to 1 million XPUs. These XPUs demand increasingly sophisticated integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance while minimizing power consumption and cost. Traditional methods like Moore's Law and process scaling are struggling to keep up with these demands. Therefore, advanced system-in-package (SiP) integration is becoming crucial for next-generation XPUs. Over the past decade, 2.5D integration, which involves integrating multiple chiplets up to 2500 mm\u00b2 of silicon and HBM modules up to 8 HBMs on an interposer, has proven valuable for XPU development. However, as new and increasingly complex LLMs are introduced, their training necessitates 3D silicon stacking for better size, power, and cost. Consequently, 3.5D integration, which combines 3D silicon stacking with 2.5D packaging, is poised to become the technology of choice for next-generation XPUs in the coming decade.\nBroadcom\u2019s 3.5D XDSiP platform achieves significant improvements in interconnect density and power efficiency compared to the Face-to-Back (F2B) approach. This innovative F2F stacking directly connects the top metal layers of the top and bottom dies, which provides a dense and reliable connection with minimal electrical interference and exceptional mechanical strength. Broadcom\u2019s 3.5D platform includes IP and proprietary design flow for efficient correct-by-construction of 3D die stacking for power, clock and signal interconnects.\nKey Benefits of Broadcom's 3.5D XDSiP\nEnhanced Interconnect Density: Achieves a 7x increase in signal density between stacked dies compared to F2B technology.\nSuperior Power Efficiency: Delivers a 10x reduction in power consumption in die-to-die interfaces by utilizing 3D HCB instead of planar die-to-die PHYs.\nReduced Latency: Minimizes latency between compute, memory, and I/O components within the 3D stack.\nCompact Form Factor: Enables smaller interposer and package sizes, resulting in cost savings and improved package warpage.\nStory Continues\nBroadcom\u2019s lead F2F 3.5D XPU integrates four compute dies, one I/O die, and six HBM modules, leveraging TSMC's cutting-edge process nodes and 2.5D CoWoS\u00ae packaging technologies. Broadcom's proprietary design flow and automation methodology, built upon industry-standard tools, has ensured first-pass success despite the chip\u2019s immense complexity. The 3.5D XDSiP has demonstrated complete functionality and exceptional performance across critical IP blocks, including high-speed SerDes, HBM memory interfaces, and die-to-die interconnects. This accomplishment underscores Broadcom's expertise in designing and testing complex 3.5D integrated circuits.\n\u201cAdvanced packaging is critical for next generation XPU clusters as we hit the limits of Moore\u2019s Law. In close collaboration with our customers, we have created a 3.5D XDSiP platform on top of the technology and tools from TSMC and EDA partners,\u201d said Frank Ostojic, Senior Vice President and General Manager, ASIC Products Division, Broadcom. \u201cBy stacking chip components vertically, Broadcom's 3.5D platform enables chip designers to pair the right fabrication processes for each component while shrinking the interposer and package size, leading to significant improvements in performance, efficiency, and cost.\u201d\n\u201cTSMC and Broadcom have collaborated closely over the past several years to bring together TSMC\u2019s most advanced logic processes and 3D chip stacking technologies with Broadcom\u2019s design expertise,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Zhang, Senior Vice President of Business Development & Global Sales and Deputy Co-COO, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. \u201cWe look forward to productizing this platform to unleash AI innovations and enable future growth.\u201d\n\u201cWith over a decade-long partnership, Fujitsu and Broadcom have successfully brought multiple generations of high-performance computing ASICs to the market,\u201d said Naoki Shinjo, SVP and Head of Advanced Technology Development, Fujitsu. \u201cBroadcom\u2019s latest 3.5D platform enables Fujitsu\u2019s next-generation 2-nanometer Arm-based processor, FUJITSU-MONAKA, to achieve high performance, low power consumption and lower cost.\u201d\nWith more than five 3.5D products in development, a majority of Broadcom\u2019s consumer AI customers have adopted the 3.5D XDSiP platform technology with production shipments starting February 2026.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently.\nU.S. e-commerce sales hit a record this year on the unofficial shopping holiday, and artificial intelligence has played a starring role. According to Adobe Analytics, online spending has hit $10.8 billion in the US, and Generative AI chatbots drove a 1,800% surge in retail site traffic compared to 2023. These tools helped bargain hunters find deals, compare products, and check out more quickly.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nSimilarly, Salesforce revealed that the use of AI-enabled online chat services grew 31% year-on-year on Black Friday, with U.S. Black Friday online sales reaching $17.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Digital retailers using generative AI and agents in their customer service experiences saw a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those who did not.\nIn other news, OpenAI\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, told the Financial Times that the company is considering introducing ads on its platform. She further revealed that the company had recently hired Kevin Weil, an executive from Instagram, who was well-suited to the task.\n\u201cThe good news with Kevin Weil at the wheel with product is that he came from Instagram. He knows how this [introducing ads] works\u201d.\nHowever, a later statement issued by Friar reveals that while OpenAI may be open to the possibility, they currently don\u2019t have any active plans for the same.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re open to exploring other revenue streams in the future, we have no active plans to pursue advertising.\u201d\nA Bloomberg Opinion\u00a0column by Dave Lee\u00a0reveals that such an apparent change in statements could be because the AI Company realized that advertisements tend to signal \u201ctroubling trends\u201d. The shift may send doubts about the profitability of its subscription-based model, raising concerns about potential \u201censhittification\u201d, as tech commentator and activist Cory Doctorow famously terms it, where user-focused features are compromised for advertiser-driven engagement and time optimization.\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s endeavors are so huge that its revenues don\u2019t manage to cover them. The development of advanced AI models would require even greater spending, which is why advertising could be seen as an avenue to help bridge the gap. However, its risks undermine ChatGPT's appeal as an alternative to Google search, potentially disrupting its user experience, Lee\u00a0noted.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides a cloud-based and AI-driven platform that enables enterprises to automate multiple management workflows. On December 3, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced an expanded strategic collaboration with new capabilities to drive AI-powered transformation throughout every aspect of the business. A key update in this collaboration involves a connector that seamlessly integrates multimodal models developed and trained on Amazon Bedrock into GenAI-powered workflows on the Now Platform. Additional automation solutions are available on the AWS marketplace, and there are also plans for expanding services to Canada and Europe in 2025.\n\u201cOur partnership with AWS is accelerating business transformation for our joint customers. More than ever before, organizations demand integrated, end-to-end solutions that enhance user experiences and optimize technology investments. Together, ServiceNow\u2019s GenAI workflows and AWS\u2019s next-gen cloud capabilities deliver on that promise.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet recently. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The enterprise software giant showcased clear progress in capturing demand for AI solutions, signing 200 deals within a week of launching Agentforce, its new AI platform for enterprise customers. In addition, Salesforce reported thousands more deals in the pipeline, hinting at robust future growth.\nReviewing some of the numbers, Salesforce reported sales and adjusted operating income ahead of Wall Street's expectations. On the other hand, EPS and some top-line growth indicators, including billings and remaining performance obligations (RPO), fell slightly below consensus estimates, as products like Tableau, MuleSoft, and Slack revealed some weaknesses. Despite the mixed top-line result, CRM recorded double-digit growth in the Sales and Service Cloud segments, which is encouraging.\nSince the onset of the AI boom, Wall Street has been craving hard data to justify the lofty projections surrounding the industry's potential. The numbers are finally trickling in, and the data suggest the AI market's trajectory might exceed initial expectations, heralding the shift from speculative hype to tangible value creation.\nThe shares closed the day at $1,123, up 6.3% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 4 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 4 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins this quarter was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million. Also, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nStory Continues\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 63.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $1,123 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,102.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nServiceNow's estimated fair value is US$881 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nServiceNow's US$1,041 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\nThe US$1,008 analyst price target for NOW is 14% more than our estimate of fair value\nHow far off is ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$4.16b\nUS$5.10b\nUS$5.77b\nUS$6.93b\nUS$7.78b\nUS$8.51b\nUS$9.14b\nUS$9.68b\nUS$10.2b\nUS$10.6b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x24\nAnalyst x16\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 12.25%\nEst @ 9.36%\nEst @ 7.34%\nEst @ 5.92%\nEst @ 4.93%\nEst @ 4.24%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%\nUS$3.9k\nUS$4.5k\nUS$4.7k\nUS$5.3k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\nStory Continues\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$11b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$253b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$253b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$130b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$182b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$1.0k, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNYSE:NOW Discounted Cash Flow November 29th 2024\nImportant Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ServiceNow as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.042. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for ServiceNow\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nMoving On:\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +9.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share, indicating a change of +15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:NOW)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)\nWhat a fantastic six months it\u2019s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is NOW a Good Business?\nFounded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.\n1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nServiceNow\u2019s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters,\u00a0its year-on-year growth averaged\u00a024.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nSell-side analysts expect ServiceNow\u2019s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nServiceNow\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate\nServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\nStory Continues\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on ServiceNow, and with the recent rally, the stock trades at 17.6x forward price-to-sales (or $1,055 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than ServiceNow\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling.

          "whole_article": "We recently published a list of 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nFamous Wall Street Analyst Bullish on ServiceNow Inc (NOW) - Here\u2019s Why\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nStory Continues\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 97\nTony Wang, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager, recently talked about his top tech picks on CNBC. ServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0is one of the stocks he\u2019s bullish on.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) impressed the market with strong Q3 results. But can the stock keep going higher? ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) recently launched its Now Platform Xanadu, adding more than 350 out-of-the-box generative AI capabilities to Now Assist. These features include data visualization automation, chat- and email-reply generation, change summaries, and LLM-based proactive prompts in Virtual Agent.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) also released RaptorDB Pro, a high-performance database enabling customers to centralize operational data and analytics onto ServiceNow platforms. These platforms are expanding the company\u2019s abilities in the IT market.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) bulls believe the company\u2019s organic revenue growth after fiscal 2025 could clock in between 20% to 22%. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) can also expand its margins by 250bps annually, driven by 100bps from gross profits, 100bps from R&D reductions, and 50bps from SG&A leverage.\nServiceNow\u00a0Inc (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0will also benefit from organic growth catalysts. Grand View Research predicts that the global information technology service management (ITSM) market will grow at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and\u00a0ServiceNow, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall, NOW ranks 6th on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
