(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks that investors probably missed.\nAI is increasingly shaping diverse industries, from healthcare and website design to cybersecurity. Companies are utilizing traditional AI and generative models to improve diagnostics, customer experiences, and business efficiency. While AI offers immense benefits, it also presents new challenges, especially in securing sensitive data. As businesses continue to innovate with AI, balancing its advantages and potential risks will be crucial for future growth.\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.\nLeveraging AI Across Sectors for Enhanced Efficiency\nAt the CNBC CFO Council Summit on December 4, Squarespace\u2019s Nathan Gooden, Zoetis\u2019s Wetteny Joseph, and Varonis\u2019s Guy Melamed shared their insights on how artificial intelligence is being integrated into their businesses. From animal health and website development to cybersecurity, these executives discussed the ways AI is improving their operations, improving customer experiences, and addressing emerging challenges. They also explored the evolving role of generative AI and its potential impact on the future of their industries.\nWetteny Joseph discussed how AI is being used in animal health, noting the integration of traditional AI in diagnostic platforms for animals, such as a system that quickly analyzes slide images to identify health issues, with potential to expand into human healthcare. Nathan Gooden highlighted the long-standing use of machine learning in the platform, and the incorporation of generative AI to simplify the website design process for customers. Guy Melamed mentioned AI\u2019s dual impact: improving customer protection while also presenting risks, such as exposing sensitive data via AI tools like co-pilot. His company focuses on securing data and preventing unauthorized access through these AI systems.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Dorsey longed for the early days of the company, saying social media incentives had driven platforms to focus on \u201ccontent and conversations that [spark] controversy and outrage.\u201d\nFive years later, that vision is taking shape with Bluesky, the social media platform born out of Twitter (now called X under Elon Musk's ownership). Bluesky, which became an independent company in 2021, has amassed millions of users since opening up to the public earlier this year.\nProponents of decentralization say the timing may finally be right for open platforms as social media moves toward a more fragmented future.\n\u201cCentralized organizations cannot serve the needs of diverse communities,\u201d Bluesky COO Rose Wang told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s why I think users have felt like they\u2019ve been left behind.\u201d\n'The promise of the early internet'\nBluesky's more than 24 million users represent a fraction of X's estimated user base, but the platform has seen significant growth following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election win.\nLast month, Bluesky remained near the top of Apple's App Store, and the app's daily downloads even briefly pushed past those of X.\nBluesky's platform is built on top of the \u201cAT Protocol,\u201d a decentralized, open-source technology that allows users control their online experiences.\nUnlike Meta\u2019s (META) suite of apps or Google\u2019s (GOOG) YouTube, where the company holds the keys to the algorithm and dictates the platform\u2019s experience, decentralized platforms allow users themselves to shape their experiences, including content moderation.\n\u201cIt reminds me of the promise of the early internet, where everybody is a publisher of their own content \u2014 very egalitarian,\u201d said Damian Rollison, director of market insights at marketing platform SOCi.\nThe company's ambitions extend beyond social media. Instead of confining users to a single platform, it aims to allow users to move their identities seamlessly from platform to platform.\n\u201cThe idea is you can put Reddit, Facebook, dating apps, Goodreads, anything on top of our protocol,\" Wang said. \"Why do you want to do that? Because then your identity, your data can actually move from platform to platform, and you're not locked into these walled gardens. You own your identity on Bluesky versus having the platforms own your identity.\u201d\nThe Bluesky app logo is displayed on a smartphone with the Bluesky icon together with X visible in the background in this photo illustration on Nov. 24, 2024. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\nAccording to Shannon McGregor, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina's Hussman School of Journalism and Media, the push for more distributed control of online experiences has been gaining steam.\nStory Continues\nA recent survey by Ipsos analyzing the role of digital platforms in eight countries found that users have a negative perception of social media and are increasingly opting for \"platform ambivalence,\" turning to multiple outlets for news and information.\n\u201cWrapped up in [the migration to alternative platforms] is the desire to be in a space that's not controlled by a single billionaire,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI think people have a desire to not be sort of at the whims of both large companies, but also singular figures.\u201d\nShifting social media landscape\nBluesky isn\u2019t the first in its quest to shake up the social media landscape. A handful of companies have attempted to reinvent the online experience.\nMastodon most recently positioned itself as the Twitter alternative following Musk\u2019s acquisition of the company in 2022. And right-wing platforms like Parler and Gab have become popular alternatives for more extremist views.\nTrump himself started Truth Social (DJT) after his Facebook and Twitter accounts were suspended in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\nBut none of those platforms have attracted a large enough user base to compete with X or Meta\u2019s apps.\nWhile Bluesky now claims more than 24 million users, that figure pales in comparison to the 275 million monthly active users on Meta's Threads.\n\"For a long time Meta has spent a lot of their money buying rivals,\" McGregor said. \"So even if there were other places that people might have gone, [Meta] bought those places, incorporated them into their own suite of apps. There's been business practices that have made other options not possible.\"\nThere are signs that may be changing. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Justice has brought cases against Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior in the tech sector.\nAnd the Trump administration isn't likely to let up on Big Tech.\nIncoming Federal Communications Chair Brendan Carr indicated the agency plans to take \u201cbroad ranging actions\u201d against major tech firms, including a review of Section 230, the law that shields companies from liability for third-party content on their platform, in a letter he penned last month.\nRollison said all of this suggests a potential opening for a decentralized platform like Bluesky to finally gain hold.\n\u201cThere are going to be platforms that serve a variety of needs and adhere to a variety of people's goals and values,\" Rollison said. \"That calcification of services centered in a few very large platforms probably does not serve consumers very well in the long term.

          "whole_article": "A tech rally pushed the major indexes to new highs last week as the latest economic data releases did little to shake investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its final meeting of 2024.\nIn the first week of December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the lone index in the red, falling about 0.5%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared more than 3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped nearly 1%.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial reading of inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is slated for release on Wednesday. A reading on wholesale inflation, the Producer Price Index (PPI), will follow on Thursday.\nIn corporate news, quarterly results from Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), C3.ai (AI), and GameStop (GME) will highlight a quiet week of scheduled company updates.\n\u2022 USD\n(^DJI)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA 'significant' inflation print\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed 227,000 new jobs were created in November, just above the 220,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2%. At large, the release didn't shift economist and investor thinking that the labor market is cooling but not at a rapid pace that would alter the Fed's interest rate-cutting path.\n\"The Fed should be in a position to move forward on the December rate cut, but next week\u2019s CPI report now becomes another significant milestone in the policy-adjustment calculus,\" BlackRock chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder wrote on Friday,\n\"The CPI and PPI price data next week will be the main determinant of the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision this month,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 85% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks at the DealBook Summit in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe final CPI release before the Fed's meeting is expected to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose 2.7% annually in November, an increase from the 2.6% in October. Prices are set to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, above the 0.2% month-over-month increase in September.\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.3% over last year in November. This would mark the fourth straight month of a 3.3% reading of core CPI. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the October gain.\n\"The disinflationary momentum is fading, and new headwinds (e.g., the potential for tariffs and tax cuts) have emerged that make the final leg of inflation's journey back to the Fed's 2% target look increasingly difficult,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note. \"The stubborn picture of inflation that has surfaced over the past few months is unlikely to be altered by the November CPI report.\"\nStory Continues\n'More of the same'\nMarkets drifted higher in the prior week in a similar fashion to that seen since President-elect Donald Trump won the nomination on Nov. 6.\nCiti US equity strategist Scott Chronert, who sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 6,100, remarked the market action has been \"more of the same\" and \"post election enthusiasm to a markets-friendly Trump administration remains at work.\"\nThis has been hallmarked by significantly low volatility in the market. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as simply the VIX (^VIX), has been hovering around 13, its lowest level since before the market drawdown seen in early August.\nAs of now, Chronert sees one clear risk event on Dec. 18 that can stop the rally into year-end.\n\"The December Fed meeting seems to be the remaining hurdle to price action into year-end,\" Chronert said.\nAnd the concern of a hawkish Jerome Powell at the Fed's final meeting of 2024 could start brewing in the week ahead if the November inflation data is worse than expected.\n\"The inflation numbers definitely are something,\" Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis told Yahoo Finance when asked what risks he's concerned about into year-end. \"If they're really out of whack, that's going to be something that people are going to look at.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(^VIX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTech takes over\nThe Magnificent Seven tech stocks roared in the past week. All seven stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 all handily outperformed the S&P 500. Meta, Amazon, and Apple all closed at record highs on Friday. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, also closed at an all-time high.\nThe move higher in Big Tech comes as many Wall Street strategists have been calling for a broadening out of stock market performance in 2025. But as we noted last week, the near-term fundamental story has been favoring the Magnificent Seven, where earnings estimates have largely been holding up better than the rest of the market.\nThis trend has some investors still bullish on the larger tech cohort headed into next year.\n\"If you overlay relative price trends of technology with relative earnings trends, they've been going hand in hand,\" Trust co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\nLerner added that on a three-year rolling basis, the Technology sector itself is outperforming the S&P 500 by 33%, a far cry from the 252% outperformance seen at the peak of the dot-com bubble. This means tech stocks, and the bull market overall, could have more room to run.\n\"Every bull market tends to have a theme,\" Lerner said. \"And if you believe the bull market is intact, which we do, then that theme is likely to continue to the end of it. And when it tops, that likely tells you we're at the top of the bull market.\"\nWeekly calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: Wholesale inventories, month-over-month, October final (0.2% prior); New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, November (2.87% prior)\nEarnings: Casey's (CASY), C3.ai (AI), MongoDB (MDB), Rent the Runway (RENT), Oracle (ORCL), Toll Brothers (TOL), Vail Resorts (MTN)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, November (94.1 expected, 93.7 prior); Nonfarm Productivity, third quarter final (2.2% expected, 2.2% prior); Unit labor costs, third quarter final, (1.4% expected, 1.9% prior)\nEarnings: AutoZone (AZO), Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Dave & Buster's (PLAY), GameStop (GME), Stitch Fix (SFIX),\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Dec. 6 (+2.8% prior); Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.2% prior); Core CPI, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); CPI, year-over-year, November (+2.7% expected, +2.6% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, November (+3.3% expected, +3.3% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+1.4% previously)\nEarnings: Adobe (ADBE), Macy's (M), Vera Bradley (VRA)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending Dec. 7 (224,000 prior); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, 0.2% previously); PPI, year-over-year, November (+2.4% prior)\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), Lovesac (LOVE)\nFriday\nEconomic data: Import prices, month-over-month, November (-0.3% expected, +0.3% prior); Export prices, month-over-month, November (-0.3% expected, +0.8% prior)\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy.\nAQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998,\u00a0 dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology.\nCliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum.\nAsness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable.\nAQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility.\nStory Continues\nAQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments.\n\"We let the machine decide more,\"\nAsness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition.\nOur Methodology:\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\nPosition size: $855 million\nActivity: -6%\nThe last time we covered AQR's META position was 6 months ago when AQR had $862 million invested in the stock. Here is what we said then:\n\"The first quarter of 2024 witnessed Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) launch Generative AI image expansion tools for Facebook and Instagram reels, which have been widely adopted by small businesses. Meta also introduced its next generation of custom chips to handle AI workloads, that enhances compute, memory bandwidth, and efficiency for ranking and recommendation models.\nMeta Platforms is further expanding on AI to optimize ad targeting and recommendation systems, driving engagement and advertising revenue. In Q1, Meta's revenue surged 27% to $36.5 billion, with 97% of this revenue sourced from ads. Ads revenue is projected to grow by 17% in 2024. Reels, a platform showing strong engagement, increased its ad load to 20% in Q1, up from 16.2% the previous year. Despite Meta's impressive Q1 results, the stock faced a decline after announcing a CapEx forecast of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion. Analysts view the increased spending positively, especially for AI projects, anticipating long-term benefits for the stock.\"\nAQR Capital hasn't materially changed its stance towards META stock over the last 6 months. It still has $855 million invested in the stock despite the 25% gain in META shares. Basically AQR has been trimming its position in META to keep the invested amount around $850 million level.\nOverall META ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other tech stocks.\nIn a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment.\nMethodology\nWe first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMeta Platforms Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm.\nIt seems that major tech companies in Silicon Valley are forging relationships with the defense industry these days. In the latest news, prominent artificial intelligence company OpenAI has entered a partnership with Anduril, a defense startup that produces missiles, drones, and software for the United States military.\nREAD NOW: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss.\nThe companies said that this partnership will emphasize on the improvement of the United States' counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) as well as their ability to deal with potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time. The CUAS will enable defense against drone strikes by detecting and intercepting them while they are airborne.\nAccording to Brian Schimpf, cofounder and CEO of Anduril, OpenAI\u2019s AI models will be used to improve systems used for air defense. The technology will be used to \u201cassess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm\u2019s way\u201d, revealed a former OpenAI employee.\n\u201cOpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values\u2026 Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.\u201d\nLast month, OpenAI rival Anthropic also entered a partnership with a famous defense contractor to provide \u201cUS intelligence and defense agencies\u201d access to its AI models. Regardless of its competitors' actions, OpenAI shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After months of tender offers and a soaring valuation, the company has reached a new record of 300 million weekly active users. The announcement was made by Sam Altman during an appearance at The New York Times\u2019 Dealbook Conference on Wednesday, December 4th. The company is reportedly targeting 1 billion active users by next year.\nThese strategies aim to strengthen OpenAI's position against competitors Anthropic and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, the latter of which Sam Altman considers a \u201cfierce competitor\u201d. Besides that, it is also striving to gain a larger slice of the generative AI market, which may top $1 trillion in revenue by the next decade. Altman also revealed that his company hasn\u2019t asked investors not to invest in its competitors. However, those who decide to wouldn\u2019t have access to OpenAI\u2019s \u201cinformation rights,\u201d like the company\u2019s roadmap and other materials.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fortified its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal artificial intelligence system. On December 6, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gearing up to launch one of its most-awaited projects: the series of cellular modem chips that aim to replace components from long-time partner and rival Qualcomm. Reportedly, Apple\u2019s in-house modem system will debut next spring. This technology is said to be part of the iPhone SE, the company\u2019s entry-level smartphone. The iPhone SE will be updated next year for the first time since 2022.\nWhen the iPhone SE debuts in a few months, it is going to have new features such as Apple Intelligence and the edge-to-edge screen design already used in more upscale models. However, the breakthrough is going to be its in-house modem, code-named Sinope. Currently, the modem won\u2019t be used in Apple\u2019s higher-end products but is set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year, code-named D23.

Former Gap (GAP) CEO Mickey Drexler knows this firsthand, courtesy of his decade-plus time at the table with Apple (AAPL) founder Steve Jobs.\n\u201cHe was a difficult person, mercurial, incredibly creative, and made sure the screws on all the products were horizontal,\u201d Drexler told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast.\nLike Jobs, Drexler commands excellence and is hooked on small details, and these traits have always been innate to him. \u201cWe were very compatible in a sense,\u201d Drexler said.\nHe was \u201cunique, once-in-a-lifetime, and [his death] a loss to America,\u201d Drexler added.\nDrexler sat on the board of Apple for 16 years during a period when Gap was valued at $15 billion \u2014 at the time, a bigger market cap than Apple.\nJobs co-founded Apple in 1976, was ousted in 1985 by its board and CEO John Sculley, and returned in heroic fashion to revitalize the company in 1997.\nHis legacy includes demystifying technology from its cryptic ones and zeros roots, bringing it into consumers' homes, and then adapting it to fit into pockets and bags. Known for his sometimes cutthroat methods and harsh critiques, Jobs remains a lauded leader in the business community.\nToday, Apple is valued at $3.67 trillion according to Yahoo Finance data. As for Gap, well, it's valued at $9.6 billion.\nWhile some managers might shy away from getting caught up in details, former Apple board member Drexler runs toward them.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a micromanager for what a customer sees, feels, and hears,\u201d he explained. \u201cI micromanage, but I provide leadership. People know what is important.\u201d\nDrexler, whose career includes stints with Bloomingdale\u2019s and J. Crew, is now chairman of his son\u2019s company, Alex Mill. To solve product issues, much like Steve Jobs, Drexler homes in on the minutiae. \u201cIf you had a bad button on a jacket, you look at the bad button,\u201d he explained\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\nApple co-founder Steve Jobs reminded Gap's former CEO why micromanaging is OK\nWhy these 2 billionaire-led crypto plays stand out as buys: Analyst\nHere's how bitcoin could hit $225,000: Analyst\nDrexler's commitment to excellence has also taken him to some fascinating places, where top brass invite him to pick his brains. One story where he put his standards on full display involved none other than the iconic Ford Mustang.\n\u201cI love them, [but] I\u2019d never own one,\u201d he recalled saying during the session.\nWhen pressed by Ford executives as to why, he was frank. \u201cThe wheels are ugly,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd all I see passing by are ugly wheels.\u201d This bluntness and honesty got Drexler invited to the design room.\nStory Continues\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be a vision,\u201d he told the team at Ford.\nAlas, \u201cit didn\u2019t go over big,\u201d he recounted to Yahoo Finance.\nHaving solid people in leadership positions that also understand the assignment is what makes or breaks a company, according to Drexler. In the leadership role, the \u201cimportant thing is managing your people,\u201d rather than to manage upward.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a really great company without strong leadership,\u201d he said.\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

Dorsey longed for the early days of the company, saying social media incentives had driven platforms to focus on \u201ccontent and conversations that [spark] controversy and outrage.\u201d\nFive years later, that vision is taking shape with Bluesky, the social media platform born out of Twitter (now called X under Elon Musk's ownership). Bluesky, which became an independent company in 2021, has amassed millions of users since opening up to the public earlier this year.\nProponents of decentralization say the timing may finally be right for open platforms as social media moves toward a more fragmented future.\n\u201cCentralized organizations cannot serve the needs of diverse communities,\u201d Bluesky COO Rose Wang told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s why I think users have felt like they\u2019ve been left behind.\u201d\n'The promise of the early internet'\nBluesky's more than 24 million users represent a fraction of X's estimated user base, but the platform has seen significant growth following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election win.\nLast month, Bluesky remained near the top of Apple's App Store, and the app's daily downloads even briefly pushed past those of X.\nBluesky's platform is built on top of the \u201cAT Protocol,\u201d a decentralized, open-source technology that allows users control their online experiences.\nUnlike Meta\u2019s (META) suite of apps or Google\u2019s (GOOG) YouTube, where the company holds the keys to the algorithm and dictates the platform\u2019s experience, decentralized platforms allow users themselves to shape their experiences, including content moderation.\n\u201cIt reminds me of the promise of the early internet, where everybody is a publisher of their own content \u2014 very egalitarian,\u201d said Damian Rollison, director of market insights at marketing platform SOCi.\nThe company's ambitions extend beyond social media. Instead of confining users to a single platform, it aims to allow users to move their identities seamlessly from platform to platform.\n\u201cThe idea is you can put Reddit, Facebook, dating apps, Goodreads, anything on top of our protocol,\" Wang said. \"Why do you want to do that? Because then your identity, your data can actually move from platform to platform, and you're not locked into these walled gardens. You own your identity on Bluesky versus having the platforms own your identity.\u201d\nThe Bluesky app logo is displayed on a smartphone with the Bluesky icon together with X visible in the background in this photo illustration on Nov. 24, 2024. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\nAccording to Shannon McGregor, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina's Hussman School of Journalism and Media, the push for more distributed control of online experiences has been gaining steam.\nStory Continues\nA recent survey by Ipsos analyzing the role of digital platforms in eight countries found that users have a negative perception of social media and are increasingly opting for \"platform ambivalence,\" turning to multiple outlets for news and information.\n\u201cWrapped up in [the migration to alternative platforms] is the desire to be in a space that's not controlled by a single billionaire,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI think people have a desire to not be sort of at the whims of both large companies, but also singular figures.\u201d\nShifting social media landscape\nBluesky isn\u2019t the first in its quest to shake up the social media landscape. A handful of companies have attempted to reinvent the online experience.\nMastodon most recently positioned itself as the Twitter alternative following Musk\u2019s acquisition of the company in 2022. And right-wing platforms like Parler and Gab have become popular alternatives for more extremist views.\nTrump himself started Truth Social (DJT) after his Facebook and Twitter accounts were suspended in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\nBut none of those platforms have attracted a large enough user base to compete with X or Meta\u2019s apps.\nWhile Bluesky now claims more than 24 million users, that figure pales in comparison to the 275 million monthly active users on Meta's Threads.\n\"For a long time Meta has spent a lot of their money buying rivals,\" McGregor said. \"So even if there were other places that people might have gone, [Meta] bought those places, incorporated them into their own suite of apps. There's been business practices that have made other options not possible.\"\nThere are signs that may be changing. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Justice has brought cases against Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior in the tech sector.\nAnd the Trump administration isn't likely to let up on Big Tech.\nIncoming Federal Communications Chair Brendan Carr indicated the agency plans to take \u201cbroad ranging actions\u201d against major tech firms, including a review of Section 230, the law that shields companies from liability for third-party content on their platform, in a letter he penned last month.\nRollison said all of this suggests a potential opening for a decentralized platform like Bluesky to finally gain hold.\n\u201cThere are going to be platforms that serve a variety of needs and adhere to a variety of people's goals and values,\" Rollison said. \"That calcification of services centered in a few very large platforms probably does not serve consumers very well in the long term.

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared more than 3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped nearly 1%.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial reading of inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is slated for release on Wednesday. A reading on wholesale inflation, the Producer Price Index (PPI), will follow on Thursday.\nIn corporate news, quarterly results from Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), C3.ai (AI), and GameStop (GME) will highlight a quiet week of scheduled company updates.\n\u2022 USD\n(^DJI)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA 'significant' inflation print\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed 227,000 new jobs were created in November, just above the 220,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2%. At large, the release didn't shift economist and investor thinking that the labor market is cooling but not at a rapid pace that would alter the Fed's interest rate-cutting path.\n\"The Fed should be in a position to move forward on the December rate cut, but next week\u2019s CPI report now becomes another significant milestone in the policy-adjustment calculus,\" BlackRock chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder wrote on Friday,\n\"The CPI and PPI price data next week will be the main determinant of the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision this month,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 85% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks at the DealBook Summit in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe final CPI release before the Fed's meeting is expected to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose 2.7% annually in November, an increase from the 2.6% in October. Prices are set to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, above the 0.2% month-over-month increase in September.\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.3% over last year in November. This would mark the fourth straight month of a 3.3% reading of core CPI. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the October gain.\n\"The disinflationary momentum is fading, and new headwinds (e.g., the potential for tariffs and tax cuts) have emerged that make the final leg of inflation's journey back to the Fed's 2% target look increasingly difficult,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note. \"The stubborn picture of inflation that has surfaced over the past few months is unlikely to be altered by the November CPI report.\"\nStory Continues\n'More of the same'\nMarkets drifted higher in the prior week in a similar fashion to that seen since President-elect Donald Trump won the nomination on Nov. 6.\nCiti US equity strategist Scott Chronert, who sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 6,100, remarked the market action has been \"more of the same\" and \"post election enthusiasm to a markets-friendly Trump administration remains at work.\"\nThis has been hallmarked by significantly low volatility in the market. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as simply the VIX (^VIX), has been hovering around 13, its lowest level since before the market drawdown seen in early August.\nAs of now, Chronert sees one clear risk event on Dec. 18 that can stop the rally into year-end.\n\"The December Fed meeting seems to be the remaining hurdle to price action into year-end,\" Chronert said.\nAnd the concern of a hawkish Jerome Powell at the Fed's final meeting of 2024 could start brewing in the week ahead if the November inflation data is worse than expected.\n\"The inflation numbers definitely are something,\" Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis told Yahoo Finance when asked what risks he's concerned about into year-end. \"If they're really out of whack, that's going to be something that people are going to look at.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(^VIX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTech takes over\nThe Magnificent Seven tech stocks roared in the past week.

Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, also closed at an all-time high.\nThe move higher in Big Tech comes as many Wall Street strategists have been calling for a broadening out of stock market performance in 2025. But as we noted last week, the near-term fundamental story has been favoring the Magnificent Seven, where earnings estimates have largely been holding up better than the rest of the market.\nThis trend has some investors still bullish on the larger tech cohort headed into next year.\n\"If you overlay relative price trends of technology with relative earnings trends, they've been going hand in hand,\" Trust co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\nLerner added that on a three-year rolling basis, the Technology sector itself is outperforming the S&P 500 by 33%, a far cry from the 252% outperformance seen at the peak of the dot-com bubble. This means tech stocks, and the bull market overall, could have more room to run.\n\"Every bull market tends to have a theme,\" Lerner said. \"And if you believe the bull market is intact, which we do, then that theme is likely to continue to the end of it. And when it tops, that likely tells you we're at the top of the bull market.\"\nWeekly calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: Wholesale inventories, month-over-month, October final (0.2% prior); New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, November (2.87% prior)\nEarnings: Casey's (CASY), C3.ai (AI), MongoDB (MDB), Rent the Runway (RENT), Oracle (ORCL), Toll Brothers (TOL), Vail Resorts (MTN)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, November (94.1 expected, 93.7 prior); Nonfarm Productivity, third quarter final (2.2% expected, 2.2% prior); Unit labor costs, third quarter final, (1.4% expected, 1.9% prior)\nEarnings: AutoZone (AZO), Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Dave & Buster's (PLAY), GameStop (GME), Stitch Fix (SFIX),\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Dec. 6 (+2.8% prior); Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.2% prior); Core CPI, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); CPI, year-over-year, November (+2.7% expected, +2.6% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, November (+3.3% expected, +3.3% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+1.4% previously)\nEarnings: Adobe (ADBE), Macy's (M), Vera Bradley (VRA)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending Dec. 7 (224,000 prior); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, 0.2% previously); PPI, year-over-year, November (+2.4% prior)\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), Lovesac (LOVE)\nFriday\nEconomic data: Import prices, month-over-month, November (-0.3% expected, +0.3% prior); Export prices, month-over-month, November (-0.3% expected, +0.8% prior)\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Dominating a Billionaire Quant's Investment Strategy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy.\nAQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998,\u00a0 dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology.\nCliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum.\nAsness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable.\nAQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility.\nStory Continues\nAQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments.\n\"We let the machine decide more,\"\nAsness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition.\nOur Methodology:\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nHere is Why Warren Buffett Sold AAPL Stock\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nPosition size: $1.87 billion\nActivity: -1%\nApple Inc (AAPL)\nAAPL stock was the third largest position in AQR's portfolio at the end of the first quarter when we last talked about AQR's AAPL investment. AAPL shares were trading at $171 at the time. Here is what we wrote:\n\"Though Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been viewed as an underdog in the AI race, but recent advancements, including the introduction of the M4-powered iPad Pro with a powerful Neural Engine, indicate a resurgence. Following AI-focused announcements at WWDC, Apple's market cap soared by over $215 billion, reaching a record high. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo emphasizes Apple's competitive edge in on-device AI capabilities whereas Gene Munster suggests Apple is a better long-term investment than Nvidia due to its AI potential. Apple's current valuation at 26 times its 2025 EPS estimate aligns reasonably with its projected sales growth, indicating its alignment with its growth prospects.\"\nAAPL stock returned more than 40% since the end of first quarter. AQR took some money off the table, but its AAPL position still increased from $1.44 billion to $1.87 billion. Overall, AQR owns 0.05% of AAPL's outstanding shares.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

Unfortunately for most investors, Magnificent Seven shares are so expensive that they're largely out of reach if you're not already wealthy (or close to it). Thankfully, that isn't the case because of a unique exchange-traded fund (ETF) that allows you to own shares in four Magnificent Seven stocks simultaneously.\nDon't Miss:\nThis well known prop trading firm is offering 100% of your first $25,000 profit per account and 90% after that. Here's how to get a special 50% OFF CODE that lets you start out with monthly investments as low as $147 today.\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF heavily focuses on big tech, which accounts for 61.4% of the 71 stocks in the ETF's portfolio. However, 45% of the ETF's portfolio is invested in Apple (13.36%), Amazon (6.82%), Microsoft (12.35%) and Nvidia (12.52%). Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia are all at the forefront of the AI revolution, while Amazon has become a dominant force in e-commerce.\nThat's impressive enough, but the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF doesn't stop there. Regarding weight allocation, every S&P 500 Magnificent Seven member is included in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's top ten. That means you'll also be investing in Meta and Tesla. The fund also holds shares in market share and sector powerhouses like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco and McDonalds.\nSee Also: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\nAll these companies offer products and services in high demand from large segments of the buying public. They also have a level of global recognition that is difficult to overestimate. According to Ycharts, the combined market cap of the S&P 500 Magnificent Seven is over $16 trillion. Ycharts data also shows that Magnificent Seven heavyweights Google, Nvidia and Microsoft are up by nearly 50% in 2024.\nThe same data also reveals the Magnificent Seven stocks have been responsible for 64.1% of the S&P 500's market cap growth for the year. So, when you buy into the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, you buy shares in multiple companies that have grown rapidly throughout 2024. They also look set for continued growth in 2025 and beyond.\nStory Continues\nTrying to buy individual shares in these companies would be cost-prohibitive for all but the most successful everyday investors. However, you can buy Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF shares for $350.36 (according to Vanguard website). Vanguard's public filings also indicate that the Mega Cap Growth ETF has increased in value by an incredible 35% in 2024.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nThe 10-year return (per Vanguard) is an impressive 16.30%, meaning this ETF also has potential as a buy-and-hold investment that can grow your wealth significantly. Although this ETF focuses more on growth than passive income, it currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.374 per share. It's easy to see the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's potential when you look at the total package.\nThe downside risk is that the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's continued performance is heavily tied to big tech's fortunes. The AI revolution is pushing companies like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia into the stratosphere regarding value, but nothing goes up forever. That's why even though this ETF is highly diversified, putting all your eggs in this one basket may not be wise.\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities? The Benzinga Real Estate Screener features the latest offerings.\nThis article If You Like Big Tech, You'll Love This ETF That Lets You Invest in Microsoft, Nvidia And Apple At The Same Time originally appeared on Benzinga.com\nView Comments"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other tech stocks.\nIn a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment.\nMethodology\nWe first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nHere is Why Warren Buffett Sold AAPL Stock\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading technology company known for its cutting-edge products. Its most popular products include the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watches, and AirPods. Its dedication to user experience has cultivated a loyal customer base, and its subscription services, including Apple Music and Apple TV+, are experiencing significant growth.\nIt has made strides in the AI sector with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, a system designed to enhance user experience across its devices. Launched in June, Apple Intelligence aims to deliver personalized AI experiences through generative models that integrate seamlessly into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\nThe company's collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) marks a pivotal move in its AI strategy. In December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported that it is currently using AWS\u2019 custom AI chips for services like search. By utilizing AWS' Trainium 2 chips for pre-training its models, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) enhances its AI capabilities while positioning itself competitively against major players like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. This partnership underscores the company's commitment to leveraging external expertise while maintaining its focus on privacy and security.\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:in) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

From animal health and website development to cybersecurity, these executives discussed the ways AI is improving their operations, improving customer experiences, and addressing emerging challenges. They also explored the evolving role of generative AI and its potential impact on the future of their industries.\nWetteny Joseph discussed how AI is being used in animal health, noting the integration of traditional AI in diagnostic platforms for animals, such as a system that quickly analyzes slide images to identify health issues, with potential to expand into human healthcare. Nathan Gooden highlighted the long-standing use of machine learning in the platform, and the incorporation of generative AI to simplify the website design process for customers. Guy Melamed mentioned AI\u2019s dual impact: improving customer protection while also presenting risks, such as exposing sensitive data via AI tools like co-pilot. His company focuses on securing data and preventing unauthorized access through these AI systems.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Dorsey longed for the early days of the company, saying social media incentives had driven platforms to focus on \u201ccontent and conversations that [spark] controversy and outrage.\u201d\nFive years later, that vision is taking shape with Bluesky, the social media platform born out of Twitter (now called X under Elon Musk's ownership). Bluesky, which became an independent company in 2021, has amassed millions of users since opening up to the public earlier this year.\nProponents of decentralization say the timing may finally be right for open platforms as social media moves toward a more fragmented future.\n\u201cCentralized organizations cannot serve the needs of diverse communities,\u201d Bluesky COO Rose Wang told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s why I think users have felt like they\u2019ve been left behind.\u201d\n'The promise of the early internet'\nBluesky's more than 24 million users represent a fraction of X's estimated user base, but the platform has seen significant growth following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election win.\nLast month, Bluesky remained near the top of Apple's App Store, and the app's daily downloads even briefly pushed past those of X.\nBluesky's platform is built on top of the \u201cAT Protocol,\u201d a decentralized, open-source technology that allows users control their online experiences.\nUnlike Meta\u2019s (META) suite of apps or Google\u2019s (GOOG) YouTube, where the company holds the keys to the algorithm and dictates the platform\u2019s experience, decentralized platforms allow users themselves to shape their experiences, including content moderation.\n\u201cIt reminds me of the promise of the early internet, where everybody is a publisher of their own content \u2014 very egalitarian,\u201d said Damian Rollison, director of market insights at marketing platform SOCi.\nThe company's ambitions extend beyond social media. Instead of confining users to a single platform, it aims to allow users to move their identities seamlessly from platform to platform.\n\u201cThe idea is you can put Reddit, Facebook, dating apps, Goodreads, anything on top of our protocol,\" Wang said. \"Why do you want to do that? Because then your identity, your data can actually move from platform to platform, and you're not locked into these walled gardens. You own your identity on Bluesky versus having the platforms own your identity.\u201d\nThe Bluesky app logo is displayed on a smartphone with the Bluesky icon together with X visible in the background in this photo illustration on Nov. 24, 2024. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\nAccording to Shannon McGregor, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina's Hussman School of Journalism and Media, the push for more distributed control of online experiences has been gaining steam.\nStory Continues\nA recent survey by Ipsos analyzing the role of digital platforms in eight countries found that users have a negative perception of social media and are increasingly opting for \"platform ambivalence,\" turning to multiple outlets for news and information.\n\u201cWrapped up in [the migration to alternative platforms] is the desire to be in a space that's not controlled by a single billionaire,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI think people have a desire to not be sort of at the whims of both large companies, but also singular figures.\u201d\nShifting social media landscape\nBluesky isn\u2019t the first in its quest to shake up the social media landscape. A handful of companies have attempted to reinvent the online experience.\nMastodon most recently positioned itself as the Twitter alternative following Musk\u2019s acquisition of the company in 2022. And right-wing platforms like Parler and Gab have become popular alternatives for more extremist views.\nTrump himself started Truth Social (DJT) after his Facebook and Twitter accounts were suspended in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\nBut none of those platforms have attracted a large enough user base to compete with X or Meta\u2019s apps.\nWhile Bluesky now claims more than 24 million users, that figure pales in comparison to the 275 million monthly active users on Meta's Threads.\n\"For a long time Meta has spent a lot of their money buying rivals,\" McGregor said. \"So even if there were other places that people might have gone, [Meta] bought those places, incorporated them into their own suite of apps. There's been business practices that have made other options not possible.\"\nThere are signs that may be changing. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Justice has brought cases against Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior in the tech sector.\nAnd the Trump administration isn't likely to let up on Big Tech.\nIncoming Federal Communications Chair Brendan Carr indicated the agency plans to take \u201cbroad ranging actions\u201d against major tech firms, including a review of Section 230, the law that shields companies from liability for third-party content on their platform, in a letter he penned last month.\nRollison said all of this suggests a potential opening for a decentralized platform like Bluesky to finally gain hold.\n\u201cThere are going to be platforms that serve a variety of needs and adhere to a variety of people's goals and values,\" Rollison said. \"That calcification of services centered in a few very large platforms probably does not serve consumers very well in the long term.

          "whole_article": "A tech rally pushed the major indexes to new highs last week as the latest economic data releases did little to shake investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its final meeting of 2024.\nIn the first week of December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the lone index in the red, falling about 0.5%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared more than 3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped nearly 1%.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial reading of inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is slated for release on Wednesday. A reading on wholesale inflation, the Producer Price Index (PPI), will follow on Thursday.\nIn corporate news, quarterly results from Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), C3.ai (AI), and GameStop (GME) will highlight a quiet week of scheduled company updates.\n\u2022 USD\n(^DJI)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA 'significant' inflation print\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed 227,000 new jobs were created in November, just above the 220,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2%. At large, the release didn't shift economist and investor thinking that the labor market is cooling but not at a rapid pace that would alter the Fed's interest rate-cutting path.\n\"The Fed should be in a position to move forward on the December rate cut, but next week\u2019s CPI report now becomes another significant milestone in the policy-adjustment calculus,\" BlackRock chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder wrote on Friday,\n\"The CPI and PPI price data next week will be the main determinant of the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision this month,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 85% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks at the DealBook Summit in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe final CPI release before the Fed's meeting is expected to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose 2.7% annually in November, an increase from the 2.6% in October. Prices are set to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, above the 0.2% month-over-month increase in September.\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.3% over last year in November. This would mark the fourth straight month of a 3.3% reading of core CPI. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the October gain.\n\"The disinflationary momentum is fading, and new headwinds (e.g., the potential for tariffs and tax cuts) have emerged that make the final leg of inflation's journey back to the Fed's 2% target look increasingly difficult,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note. \"The stubborn picture of inflation that has surfaced over the past few months is unlikely to be altered by the November CPI report.\"\nStory Continues\n'More of the same'\nMarkets drifted higher in the prior week in a similar fashion to that seen since President-elect Donald Trump won the nomination on Nov. 6.\nCiti US equity strategist Scott Chronert, who sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 6,100, remarked the market action has been \"more of the same\" and \"post election enthusiasm to a markets-friendly Trump administration remains at work.\"\nThis has been hallmarked by significantly low volatility in the market. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as simply the VIX (^VIX), has been hovering around 13, its lowest level since before the market drawdown seen in early August.\nAs of now, Chronert sees one clear risk event on Dec. 18 that can stop the rally into year-end.\n\"The December Fed meeting seems to be the remaining hurdle to price action into year-end,\" Chronert said.\nAnd the concern of a hawkish Jerome Powell at the Fed's final meeting of 2024 could start brewing in the week ahead if the November inflation data is worse than expected.\n\"The inflation numbers definitely are something,\" Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis told Yahoo Finance when asked what risks he's concerned about into year-end. \"If they're really out of whack, that's going to be something that people are going to look at.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(^VIX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTech takes over\nThe Magnificent Seven tech stocks roared in the past week. All seven stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 all handily outperformed the S&P 500. Meta, Amazon, and Apple all closed at record highs on Friday. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, also closed at an all-time high.\nThe move higher in Big Tech comes as many Wall Street strategists have been calling for a broadening out of stock market performance in 2025. But as we noted last week, the near-term fundamental story has been favoring the Magnificent Seven, where earnings estimates have largely been holding up better than the rest of the market.\nThis trend has some investors still bullish on the larger tech cohort headed into next year.\n\"If you overlay relative price trends of technology with relative earnings trends, they've been going hand in hand,\" Trust co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\nLerner added that on a three-year rolling basis, the Technology sector itself is outperforming the S&P 500 by 33%, a far cry from the 252% outperformance seen at the peak of the dot-com bubble. This means tech stocks, and the bull market overall, could have more room to run.\n\"Every bull market tends to have a theme,\" Lerner said. \"And if you believe the bull market is intact, which we do, then that theme is likely to continue to the end of it. And when it tops, that likely tells you we're at the top of the bull market.\"\nWeekly calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: Wholesale inventories, month-over-month, October final (0.2% prior); New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, November (2.87% prior)\nEarnings: Casey's (CASY), C3.ai (AI), MongoDB (MDB), Rent the Runway (RENT), Oracle (ORCL), Toll Brothers (TOL), Vail Resorts (MTN)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, November (94.1 expected, 93.7 prior); Nonfarm Productivity, third quarter final (2.2% expected, 2.2% prior); Unit labor costs, third quarter final, (1.4% expected, 1.9% prior)\nEarnings: AutoZone (AZO), Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Dave & Buster's (PLAY), GameStop (GME), Stitch Fix (SFIX),\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Dec. 6 (+2.8% prior); Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.2% prior); Core CPI, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); CPI, year-over-year, November (+2.7% expected, +2.6% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, November (+3.3% expected, +3.3% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, November (+1.4% previously)\nEarnings: Adobe (ADBE), Macy's (M), Vera Bradley (VRA)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending Dec. 7 (224,000 prior); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, November (+0.3% expected, 0.2% previously); PPI, year-over-year, November (+2.4% prior)\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), Lovesac (LOVE)\nFriday\nEconomic data: Import prices, month-over-month, November (-0.3% expected, +0.3% prior); Export prices, month-over-month, November (-0.3% expected, +0.8% prior)\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "whole_article": "Chinese sellers on overseas shopping sites, from Temu to Amazon.com, are struggling to turn a profit during this year's Black Friday sales, as fierce competition and narrowing margins take a toll on their earnings.\nA clothing factory owner in the southern trade hub of Guangzhou, surnamed Xie, said Black Friday sales at his Temu store plunged 30 per cent from last year. Another clothing factory worker surnamed Xu, who is in charge of the firm's Temu business, said the shop offered a 10 per cent discount on products from Black Friday to Cyber Monday, but sales volume was only around 20 per cent higher than usual.\n\"There wasn't much profit,\" Xu said on Thursday on the sidelines of a Temu event in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nSince their respective launch in the US in 2022 and 2023, Temu and fast-fashion giant Shein have kicked off an e-commerce war, dangling steep discounts and free shipping to entice shoppers into buying US$10 shirts and US$3 earrings mailed directly from China.\n\"Though initial estimates show an increase in overall [consumer] spending during this shopping season, there has been competitive pressure due to the emergence of Chinese e-commerce platforms,\" said Justin Koh, Shanghai-based director at consultancy AlixPartners. This year's sales period also started earlier than ever, he added.\nChinese sellers say they are finding it harder to make a profit on overseas shopping sites, such as Temu. Photo: AFP alt=Chinese sellers say they are finding it harder to make a profit on overseas shopping sites, such as Temu. Photo: AFP>\nShein is currently offering discounts of up to 90 per cent on more than 300,000 items through the end of the year. Temu is plastering tags like \"Last Day to Save\" and \"Limited Time Offer\" all over its site to woo customers.\nMeanwhile, ByteDance's fast-rising e-commerce service, TikTok Shop, invited rap star Nicki Minaj to host a live-streamed shopping event on November 24, selling nail extensions from her Pink Friday Nails brand. It broke TikTok Shop records with 3.6 million viewers and 20,000 orders, according to the platform.\nIn the first half of November, Chinese-backed shopping platforms surpassed their US rivals in terms of sales growth, according to data from Earnest Analytics. Sales at TikTok Shop, Temu and Shein were up 213 per cent, 18 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively, from the previous year. In contrast, sales at Amazon rose by a modest 0.5 per cent, albeit from a much larger base.\nStory Continues\nStill, merchants said they are finding it much harder to make money this year on both US and Chinese-backed shopping platforms. A Shenzhen-based furniture supplier surnamed Zhang, who sells on Amazon and Wayfair, said recent sales have jumped by two to threefold, \"but that's far from what we saw in 2021, when Black Friday brought a fivefold increase in sales on Amazon in one day\".\nHoliday shoppers in New York. Photo: Getty Images via AFP alt=Holiday shoppers in New York. Photo: Getty Images via AFP>\nZhang said he also had to spend 50 per cent more to place advertisements on Amazon. Profitability dropped from above 50 per cent in previous years to just over 10 per cent this time, even though he stopped offering big discounts, Zhang added.\n\"The cost of operating on Amazon has been climbing,\" said Moira Weigel, a social scientist at Harvard University who conducts research on the online marketplace ecosystem.\nSellers on Amazon are responsible for their own marketing fees, fulfilment costs and salaries for employees with e-commerce expertise. In contrast, Chinese platforms have introduced so-called full-custody or half-custody services, which handle much of the operational burden for merchants, according to Weigel.\nTemu is one site that offers such options. Guangzhou factory owner Xie said his store runs on the full-custody model, meaning that Temu takes care of everything from pricing to logistics. But the site has set prices so low - sometimes way below cost - that Xie had no choice but to remove a third of the 300 items he had listed.\nA US Postal Service employee at work during the start of the holiday mail rush following Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

Photo: Getty Images via AFP>\nDriven partly by slowing domestic demand, Chinese e-commerce players have flocked to overseas markets like the US, capitalising on the sprawling supply network at home. Amid heightened geopolitical tensions and competitive pressure, however, these companies face increasing challenges in maintaining growth.\nPDD Holdings, operator of Temu and its Chinese sibling Pinduoduo, posted a lower-than-expected 44 per cent increase in third-quarter revenue. \"Our top-line growth further moderated amid intensified competition,\" vice-president of finance Jun Liu said at the time.\nQuarter-on-quarter growth in gross merchandise value on Temu was estimated to have slowed to 15 per cent or below in the three months ended September, compared with around 50 per cent in the previous quarter, according to Chinese media outlet 36Kr.\nShein, which is looking to float its shares in London, is also experiencing a business slowdown. Its revenue growth fell to 23 per cent in the first half this year from 40 per cent last year, The Information reported last month.\nAdding to the uncertainty, US president-elect Donald Trump pledged late last month to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all products entering the US from Mexico, Canada and China.\nDespite questions on whether budget shopping sites like Temu and Shein can sustain their business model built on cut-to-the-bone pricing, rival Amazon has decided to enter the fray.\nIn November, the US e-commerce giant launched Haul, a new section on its main site that offers goods priced under US$20, targeting budget-conscious shoppers. It is inviting Chinese vendors already operating on Amazon to join the new platform.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\nCurrently, Fox Corporation has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Netflix has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FOX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\nFOX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.29, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 46.41. We also note that FOX has a PEG ratio of 1.60. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.77.\nAnother notable valuation metric for FOX is its P/B ratio of 1.78. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 17.27.\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to FOX's Value grade of A and NFLX's Value grade of D.\nFOX stands above NFLX thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that FOX is the superior value option right now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Netflix (NFLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +15.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 17.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nNetflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +99.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Netflix is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNetflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.\nOver the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNetflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "Investing.com -- Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s dominant position in the streaming landscape continues to strengthen, Raymond (NS:RYMD) James revealed in its 16th Semi-Annual Media Usage Survey.\nA key finding from the December 2024 survey is Netflix\u2019s rising penetration, which climbed to 56% from 50% in June 2024, marking a reversal after six consecutive declines. The service also holds the top spot as the \"most valued\" among respondents, with 51% indicating Netflix would be one of the three services they\u2019d keep if forced to choose. This figure significantly outpaces Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime (37%) and Hulu (25%).\nNetflix\u2019s ad-supported tier is also gaining traction. Approximately 68% of Netflix users reported utilizing the ad tier, up from 52% in June 2024, while an additional 11% expressed interest in potentially adopting it.\nThis combined figure of 79% marks a 12-point increase year-over-year, underscoring growing interest in cost-effective subscription options.\n\u201cNotably, the majority of incremental ad tier users switched from another Netflix plan rather than signing on from another service or external interest,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s report notes.\n\u201cNetflix has noted an ARPU (average revenue per unit) lift from Ads users vs. Basic subscription users, though Ads users are slightly ARPU-dilutive vs. Standard subscribers.\u201d\nAccording to Raymond James, consumer engagement with Netflix remains robust across demographics. Usage among younger viewers aged 18-29 rose five points to 57%, while older users saw a 13-point jump to the same level.\nMoreover, the survey highlights challenges for other streaming platforms. Max, Peacock, and Paramount+ saw declines, with Peacock dropping the most to 11% from 15%, despite strong Olympic viewership.\nAll three remain in the low double digits to mid-teens, significantly behind Netflix (51%), Amazon Prime (37%), and Disney\u2019s offerings (mid-20s). This raises questions about the market's ability to sustain so many services.\n\u201cWe think consolidation among these three services is likely, and see a combination of Paramount+ and Peacock as particularly likely given the incoming new leadership at Paramount, the companies\u2019 existing streaming partnership overseas, and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) expressing interest in this kind of partnership in Paramount\u2019s S-4,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s report notes.\nMeanwhile, broader market trends are improving, the report reveals, with viewership hours on the rise. More concretely, 75% of respondents said they watch two or more hours of video daily, compared to 70% in June 2024.\nStory Continues\nRelated Articles\nRaymond James' survey of media usage adds to never-stronger Netflix bull case\nRobinhood gains retail crypto mkt share from Coinbase\nSmith & Wesson shares drop after earnings miss, downgrades\nView Comments"

          "whole_article": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX).\nNetflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.91, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.91 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.1% and 4.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NFLX\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Netflix, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nStory Continues\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NFLX Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $19.78.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Netflix.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.69%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.31%.\nThe the stock of internet video service has risen by 18.1% in the past month, leading the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 10.43% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.79%.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Netflix in its upcoming earnings disclosure. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $4.20, marking a 99.05% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $10.15 billion, showing a 14.95% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $19.78 per share and revenue of $38.91 billion. These totals would mark changes of +64.42% and +15.37%, respectively, from last year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Netflix currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn the context of valuation, Netflix is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 45.62. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 9.52, which means Netflix is trading at a premium to the group.\nAlso, we should mention that NFLX has a PEG ratio of 1.74. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Broadcast Radio and Television industry was having an average PEG ratio of 0.79.\nStory Continues\nThe Broadcast Radio and Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 85, finds itself in the top 34% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine Netflix\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\nSee our latest analysis for Netflix\nWhat Is Netflix Worth?\nAccording to our valuation model, Netflix seems to be fairly priced at around 16.08% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Netflix today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $773.37, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Netflix\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nCan we expect growth from Netflix?\nNasdaqGS:NFLX Earnings and Revenue Growth December 3rd 2024\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Netflix. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NFLX\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NFLX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose 2.7% annually in November, an increase from the 2.6% in October. Prices are set to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, above the 0.2% month-over-month increase in September.\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.3% over last year in November. This would mark the fourth straight month of a 3.3% reading of core CPI. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the October gain.\n\"The disinflationary momentum is fading, and new headwinds (e.g., the potential for tariffs and tax cuts) have emerged that make the final leg of inflation's journey back to the Fed's 2% target look increasingly difficult,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note. \"The stubborn picture of inflation that has surfaced over the past few months is unlikely to be altered by the November CPI report.\"\nStory Continues\n'More of the same'\nMarkets drifted higher in the prior week in a similar fashion to that seen since President-elect Donald Trump won the nomination on Nov. 6.\nCiti US equity strategist Scott Chronert, who sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 6,100, remarked the market action has been \"more of the same\" and \"post election enthusiasm to a markets-friendly Trump administration remains at work.\"\nThis has been hallmarked by significantly low volatility in the market. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as simply the VIX (^VIX), has been hovering around 13, its lowest level since before the market drawdown seen in early August.\nAs of now, Chronert sees one clear risk event on Dec. 18 that can stop the rally into year-end.\n\"The December Fed meeting seems to be the remaining hurdle to price action into year-end,\" Chronert said.\nAnd the concern of a hawkish Jerome Powell at the Fed's final meeting of 2024 could start brewing in the week ahead if the November inflation data is worse than expected.\n\"The inflation numbers definitely are something,\" Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis told Yahoo Finance when asked what risks he's concerned about into year-end. \"If they're really out of whack, that's going to be something that people are going to look at.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(^VIX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTech takes over\nThe Magnificent Seven tech stocks roared in the past week. All seven stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 all handily outperformed the S&P 500. Meta, Amazon, and Apple all closed at record highs on Friday. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, also closed at an all-time high.\nThe move higher in Big Tech comes as many Wall Street strategists have been calling for a broadening out of stock market performance in 2025. But as we noted last week, the near-term fundamental story has been favoring the Magnificent Seven, where earnings estimates have largely been holding up better than the rest of the market.\nThis trend has some investors still bullish on the larger tech cohort headed into next year.\n\"If you overlay relative price trends of technology with relative earnings trends, they've been going hand in hand,\" Trust co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\nLerner added that on a three-year rolling basis, the Technology sector itself is outperforming the S&P 500 by 33%, a far cry from the 252% outperformance seen at the peak of the dot-com bubble. This means tech stocks, and the bull market overall, could have more room to run.\n\"Every bull market tends to have a theme,\" Lerner said. \"And if you believe the bull market is intact, which we do, then that theme is likely to continue to the end of it.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other AI stocks that investors probably missed.\nAI is increasingly shaping diverse industries, from healthcare and website design to cybersecurity. Companies are utilizing traditional AI and generative models to improve diagnostics, customer experiences, and business efficiency. While AI offers immense benefits, it also presents new challenges, especially in securing sensitive data. As businesses continue to innovate with AI, balancing its advantages and potential risks will be crucial for future growth.\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.\nLeveraging AI Across Sectors for Enhanced Efficiency\nAt the CNBC CFO Council Summit on December 4, Squarespace\u2019s Nathan Gooden, Zoetis\u2019s Wetteny Joseph, and Varonis\u2019s Guy Melamed shared their insights on how artificial intelligence is being integrated into their businesses. From animal health and website development to cybersecurity, these executives discussed the ways AI is improving their operations, improving customer experiences, and addressing emerging challenges. They also explored the evolving role of generative AI and its potential impact on the future of their industries.\nWetteny Joseph discussed how AI is being used in animal health, noting the integration of traditional AI in diagnostic platforms for animals, such as a system that quickly analyzes slide images to identify health issues, with potential to expand into human healthcare. Nathan Gooden highlighted the long-standing use of machine learning in the platform, and the incorporation of generative AI to simplify the website design process for customers. Guy Melamed mentioned AI\u2019s dual impact: improving customer protection while also presenting risks, such as exposing sensitive data via AI tools like co-pilot. His company focuses on securing data and preventing unauthorized access through these AI systems.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Dorsey longed for the early days of the company, saying social media incentives had driven platforms to focus on \u201ccontent and conversations that [spark] controversy and outrage.\u201d\nFive years later, that vision is taking shape with Bluesky, the social media platform born out of Twitter (now called X under Elon Musk's ownership). Bluesky, which became an independent company in 2021, has amassed millions of users since opening up to the public earlier this year.\nProponents of decentralization say the timing may finally be right for open platforms as social media moves toward a more fragmented future.\n\u201cCentralized organizations cannot serve the needs of diverse communities,\u201d Bluesky COO Rose Wang told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s why I think users have felt like they\u2019ve been left behind.\u201d\n'The promise of the early internet'\nBluesky's more than 24 million users represent a fraction of X's estimated user base, but the platform has seen significant growth following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election win.\nLast month, Bluesky remained near the top of Apple's App Store, and the app's daily downloads even briefly pushed past those of X.\nBluesky's platform is built on top of the \u201cAT Protocol,\u201d a decentralized, open-source technology that allows users control their online experiences.\nUnlike Meta\u2019s (META) suite of apps or Google\u2019s (GOOG) YouTube, where the company holds the keys to the algorithm and dictates the platform\u2019s experience, decentralized platforms allow users themselves to shape their experiences, including content moderation.\n\u201cIt reminds me of the promise of the early internet, where everybody is a publisher of their own content \u2014 very egalitarian,\u201d said Damian Rollison, director of market insights at marketing platform SOCi.\nThe company's ambitions extend beyond social media. Instead of confining users to a single platform, it aims to allow users to move their identities seamlessly from platform to platform.\n\u201cThe idea is you can put Reddit, Facebook, dating apps, Goodreads, anything on top of our protocol,\" Wang said. \"Why do you want to do that? Because then your identity, your data can actually move from platform to platform, and you're not locked into these walled gardens. You own your identity on Bluesky versus having the platforms own your identity.\u201d\nThe Bluesky app logo is displayed on a smartphone with the Bluesky icon together with X visible in the background in this photo illustration on Nov. 24, 2024. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\nAccording to Shannon McGregor, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina's Hussman School of Journalism and Media, the push for more distributed control of online experiences has been gaining steam.\nStory Continues\nA recent survey by Ipsos analyzing the role of digital platforms in eight countries found that users have a negative perception of social media and are increasingly opting for \"platform ambivalence,\" turning to multiple outlets for news and information.\n\u201cWrapped up in [the migration to alternative platforms] is the desire to be in a space that's not controlled by a single billionaire,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI think people have a desire to not be sort of at the whims of both large companies, but also singular figures.\u201d\nShifting social media landscape\nBluesky isn\u2019t the first in its quest to shake up the social media landscape. A handful of companies have attempted to reinvent the online experience.\nMastodon most recently positioned itself as the Twitter alternative following Musk\u2019s acquisition of the company in 2022. And right-wing platforms like Parler and Gab have become popular alternatives for more extremist views.\nTrump himself started Truth Social (DJT) after his Facebook and Twitter accounts were suspended in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\nBut none of those platforms have attracted a large enough user base to compete with X or Meta\u2019s apps.\nWhile Bluesky now claims more than 24 million users, that figure pales in comparison to the 275 million monthly active users on Meta's Threads.\n\"For a long time Meta has spent a lot of their money buying rivals,\" McGregor said. \"So even if there were other places that people might have gone, [Meta] bought those places, incorporated them into their own suite of apps. There's been business practices that have made other options not possible.\"\nThere are signs that may be changing. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Justice has brought cases against Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior in the tech sector.\nAnd the Trump administration isn't likely to let up on Big Tech.\nIncoming Federal Communications Chair Brendan Carr indicated the agency plans to take \u201cbroad ranging actions\u201d against major tech firms, including a review of Section 230, the law that shields companies from liability for third-party content on their platform, in a letter he penned last month.\nRollison said all of this suggests a potential opening for a decentralized platform like Bluesky to finally gain hold.\n\u201cThere are going to be platforms that serve a variety of needs and adhere to a variety of people's goals and values,\" Rollison said. \"That calcification of services centered in a few very large platforms probably does not serve consumers very well in the long term.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy.\nAQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998,\u00a0 dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology.\nCliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum.\nAsness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable.\nAQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility.\nStory Continues\nAQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments.\n\"We let the machine decide more,\"\nAsness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition.\nOur Methodology:\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nAlphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nPosition size: $583 million\nActivity: -23%\nAt the end of the first quarter AQR had more than $750 million invested in GOOGL stock when the stock was trading at $150. We wrote the following at the time:\n\"Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), is highly rated by analysts as a \"Strong Buy\" with an average price target of $191.83. This bullish stance is supported by expected growth in the advertising sector and accelerated U.S. eCommerce expansion, justifying a 26x multiple on Alphabet's next twelve months (NTM) earnings per share (EPS). In Q1 2024, 222 hedge funds held stakes in Alphabet, with Fisher Asset Management holding the largest at $6.9 billion. Alphabet\u2019s forward P/E ratio is 22.94, close to the S&P 500\u2019s 21, and its shares have gained 158% over four years, with revenue growing by 68%.\"\nGOOGL stock returned around 16% since then and AQR decided to trim its position by more than 20%. Overall AQR owns only 0.03% of GOOGL's outstanding shares. AQR also had $465 million invested in GOOG stock at the end of the third quarter, so overall AQR's Alphabet exposure is more than a billion dollars. GOOGL stock is exposed to two main risks. First, the regulators are trying to break up the company. Second, start-up AI companies like OpenAI, Perplexity are trying to change how consumers search for information.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 8th on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other tech stocks.\nIn a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment.\nMethodology\nWe first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is Supposedly Launching Its Next Major Gemini 2.0 Model, Set for December Release\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a leading technology company, encompassing a diverse portfolio of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo. In the third quarter of 2024, its performance was driven by the increasing demand for its search and cloud services, driven by advancements in AI.\nRecently, it has made notable improvements in its AI capabilities, particularly in enhancing search functionality by expanding the range of questions users can pose. Additionally, the company announced that new Chromebooks would feature built-in AI functionalities, further integrating advanced technology into everyday consumer products. On the shopping front, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) launched a new AI tool designed to assist consumers in selecting products by providing detailed information and recommendations.\nThe company's CEO has highlighted that AI solutions are driving deeper product adoption among existing customers while attracting new clients and securing larger contracts. This momentum is indicative of Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) strategic investments in AI infrastructure and its commitment to leveraging technology to gain a competitive advantage.\nGreensKeeper Asset Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was our largest detractor this quarter, declining by -8.8%. Global antitrust pressures have intensified, with the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission targeting several dominant technology companies, including Alphabet. Historically, Alphabet has signed agreements with Apple to serve as the exclusive default search engine for the Safari browser\u2014a practice that a US court recently ruled violated antitrust law. Despite the growing possibility that Alphabet will be required to end its exclusive distribution agreements with Apple, we believe that when faced with a choice screen, the vast majority of users will continue to select Google as their preferred search engine due to its quality advantage over competitors. In EU countries where Google was previously compelled to terminate similar agreements, 97% of users opted to retain Google as their default search engine when given a choice. A similar outcome in the United States would likely have an immaterial impact on GOOGL\u2019s earnings power. Alphabet is also facing other regulatory cases, which we monitor closely.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\nDisclosure: None.

          "whole_article": "A tech rally pushed the major indexes to new highs last week as the latest economic data releases did little to shake investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its final meeting of 2024.\nIn the first week of December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the lone index in the red, falling about 0.5%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared more than 3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped nearly 1%.\nIn the week ahead, a crucial reading of inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is slated for release on Wednesday. A reading on wholesale inflation, the Producer Price Index (PPI), will follow on Thursday.\nIn corporate news, quarterly results from Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), C3.ai (AI), and GameStop (GME) will highlight a quiet week of scheduled company updates.\n\u2022 USD\n(^DJI)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nA 'significant' inflation print\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed 227,000 new jobs were created in November, just above the 220,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2%. At large, the release didn't shift economist and investor thinking that the labor market is cooling but not at a rapid pace that would alter the Fed's interest rate-cutting path.\n\"The Fed should be in a position to move forward on the December rate cut, but next week\u2019s CPI report now becomes another significant milestone in the policy-adjustment calculus,\" BlackRock chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder wrote on Friday,\n\"The CPI and PPI price data next week will be the main determinant of the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision this month,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown.\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 85% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks at the DealBook Summit in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe final CPI release before the Fed's meeting is expected to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose 2.7% annually in November, an increase from the 2.6% in October. Prices are set to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, above the 0.2% month-over-month increase in September.\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.3% over last year in November. This would mark the fourth straight month of a 3.3% reading of core CPI. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the October gain.\n\"The disinflationary momentum is fading, and new headwinds (e.g., the potential for tariffs and tax cuts) have emerged that make the final leg of inflation's journey back to the Fed's 2% target look increasingly difficult,\" the Wells Fargo Economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note. \"The stubborn picture of inflation that has surfaced over the past few months is unlikely to be altered by the November CPI report.\"\nStory Continues\n'More of the same'\nMarkets drifted higher in the prior week in a similar fashion to that seen since President-elect Donald Trump won the nomination on Nov. 6.\nCiti US equity strategist Scott Chronert, who sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 6,100, remarked the market action has been \"more of the same\" and \"post election enthusiasm to a markets-friendly Trump administration remains at work.\"\nThis has been hallmarked by significantly low volatility in the market. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as simply the VIX (^VIX), has been hovering around 13, its lowest level since before the market drawdown seen in early August.\nAs of now, Chronert sees one clear risk event on Dec. 18 that can stop the rally into year-end.\n\"The December Fed meeting seems to be the remaining hurdle to price action into year-end,\" Chronert said.\nAnd the concern of a hawkish Jerome Powell at the Fed's final meeting of 2024 could start brewing in the week ahead if the November inflation data is worse than expected.\n\"The inflation numbers definitely are something,\" Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis told Yahoo Finance when asked what risks he's concerned about into year-end. \"If they're really out of whack, that's going to be something that people are going to look at.\"\n\u2022 USD\n(^VIX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\nTech takes over\nThe Magnificent Seven tech stocks roared in the past week. All seven stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 all handily outperformed the S&P 500. Meta, Amazon, and Apple all closed at record highs on Friday. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, also closed at an all-time high.\nThe move higher in Big Tech comes as many Wall Street strategists have been calling for a broadening out of stock market performance in 2025. But as we noted last week, the near-term fundamental story has been favoring the Magnificent Seven, where earnings estimates have largely been holding up better than the rest of the market.\nThis trend has some investors still bullish on the larger tech cohort headed into next year.\n\"If you overlay relative price trends of technology with relative earnings trends, they've been going hand in hand,\" Trust co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\nLerner added that on a three-year rolling basis, the Technology sector itself is outperforming the S&P 500 by 33%, a far cry from the 252% outperformance seen at the peak of the dot-com bubble. This means tech stocks, and the bull market overall, could have more room to run.\n\"Every bull market tends to have a theme,\" Lerner said. \"And if you believe the bull market is intact, which we do, then that theme is likely to continue to the end of it.

          "whole_article": "Image: SOPA Images (Getty Images)\nWhile Bitcoin has achieved a historic milestone of $100,000 and garnered support from prominent leaders like President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Microsoft (MSFT) has yet to decide whether to invest in the cryptocurrency. The tech giant is set to make its decision this Tuesday.\nOn December 10, shareholders of the tech giant will vote on whether Microsoft should publicly assess adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The board has recommended voting against the proposal, noting that Microsoft already evaluates a diverse range of investable assets, including Bitcoin, as part of its broader strategy.\nThe proposal, titled \u201cAssessment of Investing in Bitcoin,\u201d was submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank that advocates for Bitcoin as an \u201cexcellent, if not the best, hedge against inflation.\u201d\nDespite this endorsement, Microsoft\u2019s board of directors has remained steadfast against the proposal, stating that the company already \u201ccarefully considers this topic.\u201d This stance aligns with the views of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who has been vocal in his criticism of cryptocurrencies in the past, particularly highlighting concerns about their speculative nature.\nThe upcoming vote is significant not only for Microsoft but also for the broader cryptocurrency market. A favorable outcome could further solidify Bitcoin\u2019s status as an appealing asset for traditional corporations and financial institutions, underscoring its growing acceptance as a legitimate investment.\nFor Microsoft, a decision to reject the proposal would signal that it remains hesitant to follow the lead of other tech firms, such as MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Tesla (TSLA), which have already made substantial investments in Bitcoin. Currently, MicroStrategy holds the largest corporate Bitcoin portfolio, with 402,000 coins valued at approximately $40 billion, representing a little less than 2% of the total Bitcoin supply.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nView Comments"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy.\nAQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998,\u00a0 dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology.\nCliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum.\nAsness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable.\nAQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility.\nStory Continues\nAQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments.\n\"We let the machine decide more,\"\nAsness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition.\nOur Methodology:\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nPosition size: $1.73 billion\nActivity: 5%\nMicrosoft (MSFT) was the #1 position in AQR's portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Here is what we said six months ago:\nAnalysts from Wolfe Research and Barclays believe that Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) is well-positioned amid expected market volatility, emphasizing its resilience and investor appeal. MSFT has seen significant share price gains by 30% over the past one year. Following which multiple Wall Street analysts support bullish sentiments in addition to New Street Research that gave the Company a new Buy rating with a $570 price target. The company's strategic integration of AI in its Cloud division has driven impressive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Microsoft's investments in its Search business, Bing, have also generated market share gains. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate continued earnings growth for MSFT, making its current valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of 31, attractive.\"\nAt the time AQR had $1.67 billion invested in the stock and MSFT shares were trading at $421. MSFT stock only returned 5% since then and it isn't the top position in AQR's portfolio anymore. Overall, AQR owns only 0.05% of MSFT's outstanding shares. This may be a top 3 position for AQR but relatively AQR isn't too bullish on the stock.\nOverall MSFT ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Unfortunately for most investors, Magnificent Seven shares are so expensive that they're largely out of reach if you're not already wealthy (or close to it). Thankfully, that isn't the case because of a unique exchange-traded fund (ETF) that allows you to own shares in four Magnificent Seven stocks simultaneously.\nDon't Miss:\nThis well known prop trading firm is offering 100% of your first $25,000 profit per account and 90% after that. Here's how to get a special 50% OFF CODE that lets you start out with monthly investments as low as $147 today.\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF heavily focuses on big tech, which accounts for 61.4% of the 71 stocks in the ETF's portfolio. However, 45% of the ETF's portfolio is invested in Apple (13.36%), Amazon (6.82%), Microsoft (12.35%) and Nvidia (12.52%). Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia are all at the forefront of the AI revolution, while Amazon has become a dominant force in e-commerce.\nThat's impressive enough, but the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF doesn't stop there. Regarding weight allocation, every S&P 500 Magnificent Seven member is included in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's top ten. That means you'll also be investing in Meta and Tesla. The fund also holds shares in market share and sector powerhouses like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco and McDonalds.\nSee Also: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\nAll these companies offer products and services in high demand from large segments of the buying public. They also have a level of global recognition that is difficult to overestimate. According to Ycharts, the combined market cap of the S&P 500 Magnificent Seven is over $16 trillion. Ycharts data also shows that Magnificent Seven heavyweights Google, Nvidia and Microsoft are up by nearly 50% in 2024.\nThe same data also reveals the Magnificent Seven stocks have been responsible for 64.1% of the S&P 500's market cap growth for the year. So, when you buy into the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, you buy shares in multiple companies that have grown rapidly throughout 2024. They also look set for continued growth in 2025 and beyond.\nStory Continues\nTrying to buy individual shares in these companies would be cost-prohibitive for all but the most successful everyday investors. However, you can buy Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF shares for $350.36 (according to Vanguard website). Vanguard's public filings also indicate that the Mega Cap Growth ETF has increased in value by an incredible 35% in 2024.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nThe 10-year return (per Vanguard) is an impressive 16.30%, meaning this ETF also has potential as a buy-and-hold investment that can grow your wealth significantly. Although this ETF focuses more on growth than passive income, it currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.374 per share. It's easy to see the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's potential when you look at the total package.\nThe downside risk is that the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's continued performance is heavily tied to big tech's fortunes. The AI revolution is pushing companies like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia into the stratosphere regarding value, but nothing goes up forever. That's why even though this ETF is highly diversified, putting all your eggs in this one basket may not be wise.\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities? The Benzinga Real Estate Screener features the latest offerings.\nThis article If You Like Big Tech, You'll Love This ETF That Lets You Invest in Microsoft, Nvidia And Apple At The Same Time originally appeared on Benzinga.com\nView Comments"

Altman told US broadcaster\u00a0Fox News\u00a0that AI technology needed massive infrastructure support and that Trump would be ideal in providing it.\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\n\u201cWe need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities. I believe President-elect Trump will be very good at that\u201d.\nTrump has already picked out Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks as his AI and Crypto czar, stating that Sacks will ensure the legal framework for the token has \u201cclarity\u201d to empower the crypto industry to \u201cthrive\u201d. Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Sacks demonstrates his industry-friendly stance toward emerging technologies.\n\u201cDavid will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship\u201d.\nMeanwhile, SpaceX founder Elon Musk emerged as a key advisor to Trump after the elections. Musk has also been appointed to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is responsible for streamlining government bureaucracy.\nMusk having a potential political influence in the administration, particularly when it comes to AI, could get some people worried. However, prominent figures such as Sam Altman say they aren\u2019t. Altman brushed off suggestions that Musk, the owner of X, would use legal tactics to shut down competitors. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, is also confident about Musk\u2019s influence on the Trump administration, stating how the influence is positive because Musk \u201cdeeply\u201d knows artificial intelligence.\nThe growing momentum of AI, underscored by recent government developments, has brought attention to other key players in the sector, including Anthropic, a leading AI-focused company.\u00a0Anthropic is collaborating with Amazon to develop one of the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputers. The mega-project, codenamed \u201cProject Rainer,\u201d will be five times larger than the cluster used to build Anthropic\u2019s current most advanced model.

          "whole_article": "Key Insights\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in CrowdStrike Holdings implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\nThe top 25 shareholders own 45% of the company\nInsiders have sold recently\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 72% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$4.8b in market cap last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 51% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CrowdStrike Holdings.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Ownership Breakdown December 8th 2024\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CrowdStrike Holdings?\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nCrowdStrike Holdings already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at CrowdStrike Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Earnings and Revenue Growth December 8th 2024\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. CrowdStrike Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.9% by the third-largest shareholder. Additionally, the company's CEO George Kurtz directly holds 3.0% of the total shares outstanding.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nStory Continues\nInsider Ownership Of CrowdStrike Holdings\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.. Insiders own US$3.7b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in CrowdStrike Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for CrowdStrike Holdings you should know about.\nUltimately the future is most important.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also congratulated him.\nIn other news, OpenAI has debuted a \u201cresearch grade\u201d version of its main artificial intelligence (AI) model. The ChatGPT Pro is a $200-per-month plan that includes unlimited access to the company\u2019s smartest model, OpenAI o1, as well as to o1-mini, GPT-4o and Advanced Voice.\n\u201cAs AI becomes more advanced, it will solve increasingly complex and critical problems. It also takes significantly more compute to power these capabilities\u201d.\nChatGPT Pro also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute for thinking harder and provides even better answers to the hardest problems. OpenAI also expects to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan in the future. Moreover, the company announced that it is awarding 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions in the U.S. to help drive meaningful progress in fields that benefit humanity.\nArtificial intelligence is also shaping the healthcare industry. As per a recent study by Accenture, AI-driven healthcare has the potential to save up to $150 billion annually by 2026 in the US. \u00a0This is done by reducing administrative costs, automating patient education, and improving adherence to care plans. In particular, AI-powered assistants can provide essential, 24/7 support. In the latest news, researchers from Germany and the US have developed a deep learning framework for automated volumetric body composition analysis using whole-body MRI. Published in eBioMedicine, the study validated this approach and demonstrated its potential to predict all-cause mortality in a large Western population.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

According to Adobe Analytics, online spending has hit $10.8 billion in the US, and Generative AI chatbots drove a 1,800% surge in retail site traffic compared to 2023.

Digital retailers using generative AI and agents in their customer service experiences saw a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those who did not.\nIn other news, OpenAI\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, told the Financial Times that the company is considering introducing ads on its platform. She further revealed that the company had recently hired Kevin Weil, an executive from Instagram, who was well-suited to the task.\n\u201cThe good news with Kevin Weil at the wheel with product is that he came from Instagram. He knows how this [introducing ads] works\u201d.\nHowever, a later statement issued by Friar reveals that while OpenAI may be open to the possibility, they currently don\u2019t have any active plans for the same.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re open to exploring other revenue streams in the future, we have no active plans to pursue advertising.\u201d\nA Bloomberg Opinion\u00a0column by Dave Lee\u00a0reveals that such an apparent change in statements could be because the AI Company realized that advertisements tend to signal \u201ctroubling trends\u201d. The shift may send doubts about the profitability of its subscription-based model, raising concerns about potential \u201censhittification\u201d, as tech commentator and activist Cory Doctorow famously terms it, where user-focused features are compromised for advertiser-driven engagement and time optimization.\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s endeavors are so huge that its revenues don\u2019t manage to cover them. The development of advanced AI models would require even greater spending, which is why advertising could be seen as an avenue to help bridge the gap. However, its risks undermine ChatGPT's appeal as an alternative to Google search, potentially disrupting its user experience, Lee\u00a0noted.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Let\u2019s take a look at CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings\nWhat Is CrowdStrike Holdings Worth?\nAccording to our valuation model, CrowdStrike Holdings seems to be fairly priced at around 9.2% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy CrowdStrike Holdings today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $385.27, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since CrowdStrike Holdings\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nWhat kind of growth will CrowdStrike Holdings generate?\nNasdaqGS:CRWD Earnings and Revenue Growth December 4th 2024\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. CrowdStrike Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nWhat This Means For You\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in CRWD\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on CRWD, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nStory Continues\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing CrowdStrike Holdings at this point in time.

The latest country to embrace it is Japan. According to\u00a0The Japan Times,\u00a0private-sector businesses in the country have begun embracing related information technologies to enhance operational efficiency. GenAI search services, in particular, are proving\u00a0useful for searching corporate databases.\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI News Updates This Weekend\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nThe news states how Lion, a leading Japanese consumer goods company, has built a generative AI-powered search system that allows its researchers to search through research reports and conference materials stored in the company\u2019s database efficiently.\n\u201cTo drive innovation, we need a system that allows researchers to have quick access to technical knowledge when they need it\u201d.\nYamaoka revealed that the time required to locate a desired document has been reduced to an average of one-fifth of that with conventional search systems. The company further states that GenAI is proving beneficial not only for recruits and young employees but also for those transitioning to new workplaces, allowing them to \u201csystematically acquire knowledge in unfamiliar fields\u201d. Even though GenAI comes with its fair share of challenges such as hallucinations and copyright concerns, it also stands to benefit the corporate world in the long run.\nIn other news, one popular AI chatbot is seemingly facing a technical glitch and preventing it from saying one name in particular: David Mayer. If there is one name in the AI realm that everyone knows about, it\u2019s ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence chatbot has been trained on large amounts of data to create content, including voices, music, pictures, and videos. However, it was recently unearthed by a Reddit user that the AI chatbot is unable to say David Mayer.\nAccording to AI expert Justine Moore, a plausible scenario is that someone named David Mayer went out of his way to remove his presence from the internet. For example, strict privacy laws in the European Union allow citizens to file \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

          "whole_article": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +16%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 8.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -78.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +20.7%. This estimate has changed +10.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.36 indicates a change of +16.8% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +22.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.93 billion and $4.73 billion estimates indicate +28.5% and +20.4% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $1.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $982.26 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.84%. The EPS surprise was +14.81%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other dividend stocks that beat the market in the last 3 years.\nThe broader market has been performing strongly this year, rising by nearly 30% since the beginning of 2024. According to Morningstar Direct, the S&P 500's return has exceeded this level in only 17 of the past 74 years. For instance, in 1954, the index saw a gain of over 52%, and in 1989, it increased by about 31%. However, analysts caution investors to manage their expectations, as years with such exceptional returns are uncommon. Cathy Curtis, a certified financial planner and the founder and CEO of Curtis Financial Planning made the following comment about the market\u2019s performance this year in one of her recent interviews with CNBC:\n\u201cInvestors should know that the stock market has an average annualized return of over 10% for decades. The past year has seen growth way over this amount and it would be highly unusual for that to continue for a multi-year timeframe.\u201d\nRegardless of where the market ends up, dividend stocks have strong potential, as demonstrated over the years. During past periods of inflation, dividend stocks performed better compared to other asset classes. Since the 1940s, dividends have accounted for 40% of the market, with this share increasing during times of higher inflation, according to Hartford Funds. The report also highlighted the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they made up 73% of the market\u2019s returns. Additional studies, including one from Fidelity International, showed that dividends typically grow faster than inflation. Fidelity's research indicated that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth of dividends in the market has outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time.\nIn addition to their considerable impact on overall market returns, dividend stocks provide investors with a way to mitigate risks linked to market volatility. According to DWS Group, over the past 20 years, the monthly volatility of dividend returns was just 0.10%, compared to 3.75% for price returns. The report also noted that despite market fluctuations, investors have seen positive overall returns during this period. While riskier factors played a significant role in these returns, it was the dividend stream that proved to be a more stable and safer option amid the uncertainties of the stock market.\nREAD ALSO:\n10 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks To Invest In Right Now\nAlthough dividend stocks have recently lagged behind the broader market, they remain a popular investment choice due to their strong long-term returns. The Dividend Aristocrats Index has grown by just nearly 11% this year, but the outlook for dividend growth among US companies is promising. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, large-cap stocks outperformed many others in the first three quarters of 2024, driven by record earnings and an anticipated record dividend payout for the year. He further added that the market\u2019s large caps are expected to see a 6% increase in dividend payments for 2024, compared with 5.1% in 2023 and 10.8% in 2022.\nStory Continues\nWhen it comes to dividend investing, investors often prefer companies with a strong track record of dividend growth and solid returns as they help prepare for challenging market conditions. Additionally, investors focus on a company's ability to generate cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet, as these factors support the sustainability of future dividend payouts. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend knights that have outperformed the market in the last three years.\nOur Methodology\nFor this list, we used a stock screener and selected dividend companies that have outperformed the market in the past three years. These companies also have strong dividend growth track records under their belt. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey's data for Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their three-year returns.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n3-Year Share Price Gains as of\u00a0 December 4: 206.7%\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American multinational semiconductor company that offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. The company contributes to the development of AI infrastructure in two key areas. One is its networking portfolio, which includes components like switches and network interface cards (NICs). Switches enable communication between multiple devices, while NICs establish network connections. It is one of the best dividend knights, generating a nearly 207% return in the past three years.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered strong performance in fiscal Q3 2024, reporting $13.07 billion in revenue\u2014a 47% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This growth highlights the company's continued success in AI semiconductor solutions and VMware. Revenue from AI is expected to reach $12 billion for fiscal 2024, driven by Ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers. The integration of VMware is advancing well and is anticipated to boost adjusted EBITDA margins to 64% of revenue by the end of the fiscal year.\nIn addition to its strong performance, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also maintains a solid cash position. The company reported an operating cash flow of $5 billion and a free cash flow of $4.8 billion, representing 37% of its revenue. Broadcom returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through dividends during the quarter, solidifying its reputation as an excellent choice for dividend-focused portfolios.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) offers a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.18%, as of December 5. The company has consistently increased its payouts for 13 years in a row.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was included in 128 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a consolidated value of over $14.5 billion. With over 23.4 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.\nOverall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the best dividend knights that beat the market in the last 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently.\nWith Trump taking in the reigns soon, steps toward overhauling the US policy have begun. President-elect Trump said on Thursday that he is appointing former Pay Pal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar\u201d.\n\u201cDavid will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also congratulated him.\nIn other news, OpenAI has debuted a \u201cresearch grade\u201d version of its main artificial intelligence (AI) model. The ChatGPT Pro is a $200-per-month plan that includes unlimited access to the company\u2019s smartest model, OpenAI o1, as well as to o1-mini, GPT-4o and Advanced Voice.\n\u201cAs AI becomes more advanced, it will solve increasingly complex and critical problems. It also takes significantly more compute to power these capabilities\u201d.\nChatGPT Pro also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute for thinking harder and provides even better answers to the hardest problems. OpenAI also expects to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan in the future. Moreover, the company announced that it is awarding 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions in the U.S. to help drive meaningful progress in fields that benefit humanity.\nArtificial intelligence is also shaping the healthcare industry. As per a recent study by Accenture, AI-driven healthcare has the potential to save up to $150 billion annually by 2026 in the US. \u00a0This is done by reducing administrative costs, automating patient education, and improving adherence to care plans. In particular, AI-powered assistants can provide essential, 24/7 support. In the latest news, researchers from Germany and the US have developed a deep learning framework for automated volumetric body composition analysis using whole-body MRI. Published in eBioMedicine, the study validated this approach and demonstrated its potential to predict all-cause mortality in a large Western population.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company engaged in the design, development, and supply of a broad range of semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions. Its custom chip offerings and networking assets position it uniquely in the AI space. On December 6, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained a \u201cHold\u201d rating on the stock and a $170.00 price target.\nRakers rating stems from various factors, but mainly considers Broadcom\u2019s AI revenue potential and conservative guidance for FY25. The company is expected to report positive F4Q24 results, and investors are keen on its AI silicon expansion and diversification. AI semiconductor revenue is also poised to demonstrate substantial growth, even though there is an air of uncertainty due to investors hoping for even higher figures.\nBroadcom\u2019s non-AI semiconductor business is also stabilizing, reducing overall risk.

She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7.\nThe discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer.\nLooking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors.\nStory Continues\nHer insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment.\nMethodology\nWe first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor and infrastructure software company. While it's known for its ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), it provides a range of products like cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. It serves key markets including data centers, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless.\nThis year, the company launched cutting-edge AI technologies, including the VeloRAIN, an AI-powered security platform, and a private cloud platform for enhanced AI autonomy and security. Driven by strong demand for ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators, the company expects AI revenue to reach $3.5 billion in Q4 2024, contributing to a projected full-year AI revenue of $12 billion.\nThe company recently announced an advancement in its custom chip technology. Recognizing the surge in demand for GenAI, it has developed 3.5D XDSiP, a solution designed to enhance the speed and performance of custom AI processors. This technological leap is crucial for Broadcom Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVGO) growing customer base of hyperscalers, who are increasingly relying on custom chips to diversify their supply chains and reduce dependence on expensive NVIDIA processors.\nIts focus on developing groundbreaking technologies serves as a key competitive advantage. Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIn IT, we bought\u00a0Broadcom Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.\u201d\nOverall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment.

          "whole_article": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing to finally bring one of its most ambitious projects to market: a series of cellular modem chips that will replace components from longtime partner \u2014 and adversary \u2014 Qualcomm Inc.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect\nNYC\u2019s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp\nKansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit\nMore than half a decade in the making, Apple\u2019s in-house modem system will debut next spring, according to people familiar with the matter. The technology is slated to be part of the iPhone SE, the company\u2019s entry-level smartphone, which will be updated next year for the first time since 2022.\nA modem is a critical piece of any mobile phone, letting the device connect to cell towers in order to make calls and link up with the internet. Apple\u2019s first version of the component will be followed by further generations that become increasingly more advanced. The company aims to ultimately overtake Qualcomm\u2019s technology by 2027, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project is confidential.\nApple\u2019s modem has been a long time coming. When the company set out to build the chip, it originally hoped to bring it to market as early as 2021. To jump-start the effort, the company invested billions of dollars to set up testing and engineering labs around the world. It also spent about $1 billion to acquire Intel Corp.\u2019s modem group and millions more hiring engineers from other silicon companies.\nOver the years, Apple encountered setback after setback. Early prototypes were too large, ran too hot and weren\u2019t power-efficient enough. There also were concerns internally that Apple was simply developing a modem to get back at Qualcomm, following a legal battle over licensing payments that didn\u2019t go the iPhone maker\u2019s way.\nBut after adjusting development practices, reorganizing management and hiring scores of new engineers from Qualcomm itself, Apple is now confident that its modem plan will work, the people said. It would be a major win for the company\u2019s hardware technologies team, which is run by Senior Vice President Johny Srouji.\nRepresentatives for Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment.\nQualcomm has long been preparing for Apple to switch away from its modems, but the company still receives more than 20% of its revenue from the iPhone maker, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its stock fell as much as 2% to a session low after Bloomberg News reported on Apple\u2019s plans Friday. It closed at $159.51 in New York trading, down less than 1%.\nStory Continues\nShares of Qorvo Inc., another component supplier at risk of being replaced by Apple\u2019s modem efforts, declined as much as 6% before recovering. Apple shares were little changed.\nWhen the iPhone SE debuts in a few months, it will have major new features, including Apple Intelligence and the edge-to-edge screen design already used in more upscale models. But its most impressive breakthrough won\u2019t be visible to consumers: the in-house modem, code-named Sinope.\nFor now, the modem won\u2019t be used in Apple\u2019s higher-end products. It\u2019s set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year, code-named D23, that features a far-thinner design than current models. The chip will also start rolling out as early as 2025 in Apple\u2019s lower-end iPads.\nIn preparation for the iPhone SE, Cupertino, California-based Apple has been secretly testing the new modem on hundreds of devices deployed to employees globally. And it has been doing quality assurance testing with its carrier partners around the world.\nThe company decided to start with lower-end products in part because a modem is a risky endeavor: If it doesn\u2019t work properly, customers will suffer dropped calls and missed notifications. There\u2019s little tolerance for that on Apple\u2019s highest-end, $1,000-plus iPhones.\nMoreover, Sinope isn\u2019t as advanced as the latest modems from San Diego-based Qualcomm, meaning the first Apple modem is a downgrade from the component currently in the iPhone 16 Pro.\nUnlike today\u2019s high-end Qualcomm parts, the Sinope modem won\u2019t support mmWave, a type of 5G technology used by Verizon Wireless and other carriers, primarily in major cities, that can theoretically handle download speeds of as much as 10 gigabits per second. Instead, the Apple component will rely on the Sub-6 standard, a more prevalent technology used by the current iPhone SE.\nThe first Apple modem will also only support four-carrier aggregation, a technology that combines bands from several wireless providers simultaneously to increase network capacity and speeds. Modems from Qualcomm can support six or more carriers at the same time.\nIn lab tests, the first Apple modem caps out at download speeds of about 4 gigabits per second, less than the top speeds offered by non-mmWave Qualcomm modems, the people said. Real world speeds for both types of modems are typically far less, meaning that customers might not notice a difference in day-to-day use.\nIn any case, the first Apple modem will have several other advantages that the company believes will give it an edge with consumers. For one, it will be tightly integrated with Apple-designed main processors to use less power, scan for cellular service more efficiently and better support on-device features for connecting to satellite networks.\nThe Apple modem will also be able to offer better performance relative to SAR limits because it will be managed intelligently via the main processor, the people said. SAR, or specific absorption rate, is a measure of the radio frequency absorbed by the body, and government agencies such as the US Federal Communications Commission regulate acceptable levels.\nApple is also planning to include support for DSDS, or dual SIM dual standby. That allows data connections on both SIM cards when a user is using two phone numbers for their device.\nThe new modem will be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the manufacturer of the main processors inside the iPhone, iPad, Mac and other Apple devices.\nTo help build its modem, Apple rapidly expanded its office space in San Diego and other parts of Southern California, looking to poach talent from Qualcomm. Executives involved in the modem\u2019s development believe that some of the resources and talent acquired from Intel in 2019 were inadequate, and that hiring from Qualcomm helped Apple overcome earlier setbacks.\nSome of the development work for the modems has also taken place in Cupertino and offices in Munich.\nThe modem will work with another new Apple component: a radio frequency front-end system, or RFFE, called Carpo that helps devices connect to cellular networks.\nThat part will also take away business from Qualcomm, and could eventually affect Qorvo as well. Today, Apple uses Skyworks Solutions Inc. and Broadcom Inc. for so-called RF filters \u2014 relationships that will continue. Apple and Broadcom extended their supply agreement in 2023.\nShares of Broadcom gained 5.3%, while Skyworks climbed 1.7%.\nIn 2026, Apple looks to get closer to Qualcomm\u2019s capabilities with its second-generation modem, which will start appearing in higher-end products. This chip, Ganymede, is expected to go into the iPhone 18 line that year, as well as upscale iPads by 2027\nThe big difference is that Ganymede will catch up to current Qualcomm modems by adding support for mmWave, download speeds of 6 gigabits per second, six-carrier aggregation when using Sub-6, and eight-carrier aggregation when using mmWave.\nIn 2027, Apple aims to roll out its third modem, code-named Prometheus. The company hopes to top Qualcomm with that component\u2019s performance and artificial intelligence features by that point. It will also build in support for next-generation satellite networks.\nFurther out, Apple is discussing merging its modem and main processor into a single component.\n(Update shares in shares starting in eighth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDubai\u2019s Alleged Crypto Scams Are Raking in Billions\nThe Quest to Turn Human Waste Into Medicine\nHow a Billionaire\u2019s \u2018Baby Project\u2019 Ensnared Dozens of Women\nWho Will Clean Up Shell\u2019s Mess in Nigeria?\nA New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView Comments"

(AVGO), which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nThis chipmaker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.59%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Broadcom Inc. Was expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share, but it reported $1.24 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.33%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.08 per share, while it actually produced $1.10 per share, a surprise of 1.85%.\nFor Broadcom Inc.Estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nBroadcom Inc. Currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.84%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on December 12, 2024.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nStory Continues\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Forbes real-time billionaires list shows that Ellison is currently the third-richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $229.4bn.\nOracle shares climbed after the company posted better-than-expected results in September for its fiscal first quarter.\nAdjusted revenue of $13.31bn beat analyst forecasts of $13.26bn, while adjusted earnings of $1.39 came in ahead of estimates of $1.33.\nRead more: How will Trump's tariffs impact UK and EU trade?\nOracle also announced partnerships with fellow tech giants Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on the same day that the results were published.\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance at the time, Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead said that as AI becomes more of a priority, this data will be the company's biggest play.\n\"The biggest obstruction from enterprises going hardcore into AI is the data problem,\" he said. \"It's getting the data right. It's co-mingling the right data to give generative AI the right solutions without leaking confidential information.\"\nFor certain customers, Moorhead said this meant that \"Oracle is the place to go. So they will be the data broker for the generative AI age.\"\nStory continues\nIn its latest rating, investment bank Jefferies maintained a \"buy\" recommendation on Oracle's stock but raised its price target on the shares from $190 to $220.\n\u2022 USD\n(ORCL)\nFollow\nView quote details\nBroadcom (AVGO) \u2014 Reports fourth quarter earnings on Thursday 12 December\nChipmaker Broadcom's guidance in September for fourth quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company said it expected revenue to come in at $14bn in the final quarter, versus estimates of $14.13bn.\nHowever, revenue for the third quarter of $13.07bn was slightly better than the expected $13.03bn. Adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share also topped the $1.22 estimate.\nShares fell following the release of these results in September, though the stock has recovered and is up 53% year-to-date.\nAnalysts have remained bullish on the stock, with UBS (UBSG.SW) most recently keeping its \"buy\" rating on Broadcom shares, raising their price target from $170 to $200.\nRead more: Global chip stocks to consider as investments beyond Nvidia\nChip stocks have benefitted from strong demand amid the global race to invest in AI, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index, known as the SOX (^SOX), up 20% year-to-date.\nHowever, there has been some pressure on shares more recently amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China.\nThis week Chinese industry bodies said that companies domestically should be careful of buying US chips, saying that they were \"no longer safe\" and encouraging them to buy locally instead. This came after the US launched crackdowns on exports of chips to Chinese companies.\nThe rise in trade tensions is happening even before US president-elect Donald Trump has returned to office. Trump, who is due to return to the White House in January, has proposed wide-sweeping tariffs on countries, particularly China.\n\u2022 USD\n(AVGO)\nFollow\nView quote details\nIndustria de Diseno Textil, S.A.

They also forecast net income of \u20ac1.74bn, up 10% year-on-year.\nIn addition to how the company has been trading in November and December, the analysts said investors would also be looking for any discussion of the impact of potential US trade tariffs and whether \"increased visibility of collaborations is a deliberate strategy to help elevate the brand\".\n\u2022 USD\n(ITX.MC)\nFollow\nView quote details\nBritish American Tobacco (BATS.L) \u2014 Releases full-year trading update on Wednesday 11 December\nDespite increasing regulatory pushback on the sector, shares in British American Tobacco (BAT) are still up 29% year-to-date.\nShares rose on the back of BAT's interim results in July, in which the tobacco giant reported earnings per share of 169.3p for the first half. This beat analyst estimates of 165.9p per share, according to Reuters.\nRevenues were down 8% year-on-year to \u00a312.3bn ($15.6bn) in the first half.

Over the same timeframe, the sector and industry have returned 37.7% and 55.4%, respectively.\n\nAVGO is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. Broadcom\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst.\n\nStrong demand for Broadcom\u2019s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) earns a Zacks Rank #2 six days from its next quarterly earnings release on December 12, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.40 a share.\nBroadcom Inc.'s Earnings ESP sits at 0.84%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.40 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39.\nAVGO is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Okta (OKTA) as well.\nOkta is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 26, 2025. OKTA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.71 a share 82 days from its next earnings release.\nFor Okta, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.69 is 3.11%.\nAVGO and OKTA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against other top AI news stories for the weekend.\nLast week, Sam Altman, CEO of AI company OpenAI, expressed his confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration will support the artificial intelligence sector, ensuring the United States and its allies continue their lead. Altman told US broadcaster\u00a0Fox News\u00a0that AI technology needed massive infrastructure support and that Trump would be ideal in providing it.\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\n\u201cWe need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities. I believe President-elect Trump will be very good at that\u201d.\nTrump has already picked out Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks as his AI and Crypto czar, stating that Sacks will ensure the legal framework for the token has \u201cclarity\u201d to empower the crypto industry to \u201cthrive\u201d. Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Sacks demonstrates his industry-friendly stance toward emerging technologies.\n\u201cDavid will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship\u201d.\nMeanwhile, SpaceX founder Elon Musk emerged as a key advisor to Trump after the elections. Musk has also been appointed to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is responsible for streamlining government bureaucracy.\nMusk having a potential political influence in the administration, particularly when it comes to AI, could get some people worried. However, prominent figures such as Sam Altman say they aren\u2019t. Altman brushed off suggestions that Musk, the owner of X, would use legal tactics to shut down competitors. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, is also confident about Musk\u2019s influence on the Trump administration, stating how the influence is positive because Musk \u201cdeeply\u201d knows artificial intelligence.\nThe growing momentum of AI, underscored by recent government developments, has brought attention to other key players in the sector, including Anthropic, a leading AI-focused company.\u00a0Anthropic is collaborating with Amazon to develop one of the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputers. The mega-project, codenamed \u201cProject Rainer,\u201d will be five times larger than the cluster used to build Anthropic\u2019s current most advanced model. As reported by\u00a0WIRED, the announcement was made at the company\u2019s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas by Matt Garman, CEO of AWS. Once it is completed, the supercomputer will be the world\u2019s largest AI machine featuring hundreds of thousands of its latest Trainium 2 AI training chips.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) Receives 'Buy' Rating as AI-Driven Solutions Boost Growth Prospects\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based platform that leverages AI and machine learning to enable enterprises to streamline workflow automation, enhance IT service management, and optimize other enterprise applications. On December 5, Analyst Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo assigned a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on ServiceNow with a price target of $1,250.00. Gina Mastantuono, company CFO, expressed cautious optimism regarding 2025 IT budgets, indicating potential growth beyond 2024. The company is well-suited to provide clients with both revenue-generating and cost-saving solutions.\nIn particular, ServiceNow\u2019s strong focus on artificial intelligence, predominantly through initiatives such as its early adoption through the Xanadu initiative and the Now Assist platform, puts it on track for future growth. The company\u2019s focus on enhancing customer service through AI and database offerings, including RaptorDB Pro and Knowledge Graph, further emphasizes innovation and efficiency. Lastly, increased operating leverage and ongoing cost efficiencies solidify the buy rating.\nOverall, NOW ranks 1st on our list of top AI news stories for the weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently.\nU.S. e-commerce sales hit a record this year on the unofficial shopping holiday, and artificial intelligence has played a starring role. According to Adobe Analytics, online spending has hit $10.8 billion in the US, and Generative AI chatbots drove a 1,800% surge in retail site traffic compared to 2023. These tools helped bargain hunters find deals, compare products, and check out more quickly.\nREAD NOW:\u00a015 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\u00a0and\u00a015 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\nSimilarly, Salesforce revealed that the use of AI-enabled online chat services grew 31% year-on-year on Black Friday, with U.S. Black Friday online sales reaching $17.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Digital retailers using generative AI and agents in their customer service experiences saw a 9% higher conversion rate compared to those who did not.\nIn other news, OpenAI\u2019s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, told the Financial Times that the company is considering introducing ads on its platform. She further revealed that the company had recently hired Kevin Weil, an executive from Instagram, who was well-suited to the task.\n\u201cThe good news with Kevin Weil at the wheel with product is that he came from Instagram. He knows how this [introducing ads] works\u201d.\nHowever, a later statement issued by Friar reveals that while OpenAI may be open to the possibility, they currently don\u2019t have any active plans for the same.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re open to exploring other revenue streams in the future, we have no active plans to pursue advertising.\u201d\nA Bloomberg Opinion\u00a0column by Dave Lee\u00a0reveals that such an apparent change in statements could be because the AI Company realized that advertisements tend to signal \u201ctroubling trends\u201d. The shift may send doubts about the profitability of its subscription-based model, raising concerns about potential \u201censhittification\u201d, as tech commentator and activist Cory Doctorow famously terms it, where user-focused features are compromised for advertiser-driven engagement and time optimization.\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s endeavors are so huge that its revenues don\u2019t manage to cover them. The development of advanced AI models would require even greater spending, which is why advertising could be seen as an avenue to help bridge the gap. However, its risks undermine ChatGPT's appeal as an alternative to Google search, potentially disrupting its user experience, Lee\u00a0noted.\nStory Continues\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

On December 3, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced an expanded strategic collaboration with new capabilities to drive AI-powered transformation throughout every aspect of the business. A key update in this collaboration involves a connector that seamlessly integrates multimodal models developed and trained on Amazon Bedrock into GenAI-powered workflows on the Now Platform. Additional automation solutions are available on the AWS marketplace, and there are also plans for expanding services to Canada and Europe in 2025.\n\u201cOur partnership with AWS is accelerating business transformation for our joint customers. More than ever before, organizations demand integrated, end-to-end solutions that enhance user experiences and optimize technology investments. Together, ServiceNow\u2019s GenAI workflows and AWS\u2019s next-gen cloud capabilities deliver on that promise.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet recently.

The enterprise software giant showcased clear progress in capturing demand for AI solutions, signing 200 deals within a week of launching Agentforce, its new AI platform for enterprise customers. In addition, Salesforce reported thousands more deals in the pipeline, hinting at robust future growth.\nReviewing some of the numbers, Salesforce reported sales and adjusted operating income ahead of Wall Street's expectations. On the other hand, EPS and some top-line growth indicators, including billings and remaining performance obligations (RPO), fell slightly below consensus estimates, as products like Tableau, MuleSoft, and Slack revealed some weaknesses. Despite the mixed top-line result, CRM recorded double-digit growth in the Sales and Service Cloud segments, which is encouraging.\nSince the onset of the AI boom, Wall Street has been craving hard data to justify the lofty projections surrounding the industry's potential. The numbers are finally trickling in, and the data suggest the AI market's trajectory might exceed initial expectations, heralding the shift from speculative hype to tangible value creation.\nThe shares closed the day at $1,123, up 6.3% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 4 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 4 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins this quarter was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\nMoving on to its AI capabilities, management provided promising insights. NowAssist (AI product) net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter and became the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. Notably, the company inked 11 NowAssist deals with $1 million+ ACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million. Also, the company noted that Dell would be integrating NowAssist. Alongside similar deals, this could significantly accelerate ServiceNow's reach in the AI automation space.\nStory Continues\nOverall, this was a strong quarter with the company's improved visibility in its deal pipeline providing strong conviction in its near term forecasts. Alongside its AI momentum, investors have ample reasons to stay positive.\nServiceNow is up 63.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $1,123 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,102.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\nView Comments"

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.56%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.42%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.83%.\nThe the stock of maker of software that automates companies' technology operations has risen by 11.62% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.44% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.11%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of ServiceNow in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $3.60, indicating a 15.76% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.96 billion, up 21.28% from the prior-year quarter.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.87 per share and revenue of $10.97 billion. These totals would mark changes of +28.66% and +22.33%, respectively, from last year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for ServiceNow should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. At present, ServiceNow boasts a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nInvestors should also note ServiceNow's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 75.09. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 30.22 for its industry.\nWe can also see that NOW currently has a PEG ratio of 3.05. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Computers - IT Services industry stood at 2.82 at the close of the market yesterday.\nStory Continues\nThe Computers - IT Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 39, which puts it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NOW) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nView our latest analysis for ServiceNow\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$4.16b\nUS$5.10b\nUS$5.77b\nUS$6.93b\nUS$7.78b\nUS$8.51b\nUS$9.14b\nUS$9.68b\nUS$10.2b\nUS$10.6b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x24\nAnalyst x16\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 12.25%\nEst @ 9.36%\nEst @ 7.34%\nEst @ 5.92%\nEst @ 4.93%\nEst @ 4.24%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%\nUS$3.9k\nUS$4.5k\nUS$4.7k\nUS$5.3k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.7k\nUS$5.6k\nUS$5.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\nStory Continues\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$11b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$253b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$253b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$130b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$182b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$1.0k, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNYSE:NOW Discounted Cash Flow November 29th 2024\nImportant Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ServiceNow as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.042. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for ServiceNow\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nMoving On:\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

          "whole_article": "ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +9.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which ServiceNow belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share, indicating a change of +15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow.\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates indicate +22.3% and +20.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

          "whole_article": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy\u2019s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\nStory Continues\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI \u2014 AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\ndata center\nA team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.\nPolen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.\u201d\nOverall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

          "whole_article": "Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)\nWhat a fantastic six months it\u2019s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\nIs now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\nWhy Is NOW a Good Business?\nFounded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.\n1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nServiceNow\u2019s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters,\u00a0its year-on-year growth averaged\u00a024.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company\u2019s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.\nServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.\nSell-side analysts expect ServiceNow\u2019s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nServiceNow\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate\nServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\nStory Continues\nFinal Judgment\nThese are just a few reasons why we're bullish on ServiceNow, and with the recent rally, the stock trades at 17.6x forward price-to-sales (or $1,055 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\nStocks We Like Even More Than ServiceNow\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we\u2019re here to help you pick them.\nGet started by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like United Rentals (+550% five-year return).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.\n\u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d\nHowever, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.\n\u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings.

These platforms are expanding the company\u2019s abilities in the IT market.\nServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) bulls believe the company\u2019s organic revenue growth after fiscal 2025 could clock in between 20% to 22%.
