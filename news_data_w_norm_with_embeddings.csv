20241113,META,"(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. will face a somewhat scaled-back antitrust trial over its alleged dominance of social networking after a federal judge threw out some allegations by the US Federal Trade Commission, but the heart of the case remains.

In a 92-page order on Wednesday, US District Judge James Boasberg in Washington said he was narrowing one of the FTC’s claims. He accepted Meta’s arguments that some of its restrictions on its Facebook platform had legitimate business justifications.
But the judge rejected the company’s main contention — that its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were good for consumers and not an effort to dominate the personal social-networking market. Boasberg left that issue to be decided at trial. He also ruled in favor of the FTC that Meta can’t argue it needed the acquisitions to compete against Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.
The lawsuit, filed in 2020, is one of two by the first Trump administration aimed at curtailing the power of the largest US tech platforms.
Despite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC’s chances at trial. “Prevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,” the judge said. “Indeed, its positions at times strain this country’s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.”
Meta said its defense is strong.
“We are confident that the evidence at trial will show that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have been good for competition and consumers,” Meta spokesperson Christopher Sgro said in a statement, adding that the FTC “is wrongly continuing to assert that no deal is ever truly final, and businesses can be punished for innovating.”
The FTC said the case will protect innovation.
“This case, which began under President Trump and was refined during the Biden administration, represents a bipartisan effort to curtail Meta’s monopoly power and restore competition to ensure freedom and innovation in the social media ecosystem,” FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said in a statement.
In April, Meta asked Boasberg to dismiss the FTC’s suit outright, without a trial, arguing that the agency can’t prove consumers would be better off without its acquisitions of the two apps.
Story Continues
In its suit, the antitrust agency alleged that the company illegally dominated the US personal social-networking market by buying up emerging rivals.
The judge is to schedule a trial date at a hearing this month.
The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms Inc., 20-cv-03590, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).

20241113,META,"Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) are fighting two Supreme Court cases this year that they claim will flood the legal system with investor lawsuits if not decided in their favor.
So far, things aren't exactly going their way.
Nvidia’s lawyers made their case before the high court on Wednesday and drew skepticism from justices across the ideological spectrum. The same happened to Meta’s lawyers last week.
“It just seems to me that you're asking us to engage in a kind of analysis that we are not very good at,” Justice Elena Kagan, an appointee by Democratic President Barack Obama, told Nvidia’s lawyer Neal Kumar Katyal.
The outcome of the cases could undermine or embolden future securities fraud litigants.
Nvidia argues that investors who sued the company alleging that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made false statements should be required to present more particular information in their lawsuit about what Huang knew at the time of his statements.
The investors claim that in 2017 and 2018, Huang knowingly departed from Nvidia’s internal company data by misattributing the company’s demand for chips to the video gaming market.

Demand at the time, the investors hypothesized, was actually driven by the more volatile market of cryptocurrency mining. That hypothesis relied on the opinion of a financial analyst who based his conclusion on publicly available documents, rather than Nvidia’s company documents.
“This is a highly technical subject, and I just don't understand how a court is opposed to be evaluating that at the pleading stage,” Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, told Nvidia’s lawyer.
The justices pressed Nvidia to explain why they should reverse a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, repeating a point they made in the case against Meta's Facebook argued last week.
In both cases, the appellate court allowed investors to proceed against the companies with proposed class-action securities fraud suits.
Yale Law School professor Jonathan Macey said he was surprised by the justices’ questions in the Facebook case.
“One thing that was amazing in the oral argument,” he said, “is you've got this kind of across-the-aisle alliance” with conservative Justice Clarence Thomas to liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressing concerns that were “very pro-plaintiff.”
Facebook, for its part, said investors should not be able to allege that it misled its stockholders by omitting that its partnership with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users.
Story Continues
At the core of both disputes are questions about what facts a plaintiff must include in a legal complaint to keep a case in court.
Facebook argued that its disclosures were not false or misleading by failing to disclose that the Cambridge Analytica breach actually materialized in the past, especially because the so-called risk posed no known risk of ongoing or future business harm.

According to Nvidia, investors should not be able to maintain a proposed class-action lawsuit against the company by relying on an expert’s opinion.
“Congress … wanted to stop lawsuits like this, lawsuits that allowed for fraud by hindsight,” Katyal said on behalf of Nvidia during Wednesday’s arguments.
“When a stock drops, all [plaintiffs] have to do is find an expert with numbers that contradict a company's public statements,” Katyal said.
Katyal went on to say that a decision in favor of the shareholders created “an easy road map” for plaintiffs to evade a federal law that requires particular information to be included in a securities fraud complaint.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), which was in part created to prevent frivolous lawsuits, states that a plaintiff must show that a defendant company intended to make a false or misleading statement and that the statement was, in fact, false.
Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, also entertained the idea that the PSLRA may need refining.
Gorsuch said “it beggars belief” to think that a CEO, such as Huang, would have been unaware of the source of such a large portion of the company's income.
Jim Redwood, a securities law professor with Albany Law, doubted that Supreme Court would ultimately rule in favor of the investors, saying he expects both cases to be resolved in a manner that curbs future securities class action lawsuits.
“The Facebook case is somewhat closer,” he said, explaining that the social media company’s case may be somewhat weaker than Nvidia’s.
The Justice Department joined in the Nvidia case, siding with investors.
“We think that the 9th Circuit correctly applied the standard here,” the DOJ’s lawyer said during arguments on Wednesday.

20241113,META,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Virtual Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best virtual reality stocks.
Overview of the Global VR Market
Virtual Reality is a computer-generated simulation that allows users to interact with a three-dimensional environment. The four elements that characterize virtual reality and differentiate it from other technologies such as augmented reality and mixed reality are a 3D-simulated environment, immersion, sensory engagement, and realistic interactivity, as revealed by HP.
According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global virtual reality market size was valued at $25.11 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow from $32.64 billion in 2024 to $244.84 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 28.6% during the forecast period (2024-2032).
Region-wise, North America is expected to dominate the global VR market over the forecast period. Another rapidly growing region is Asia Pacific with growth driven by the rising demand for immersive technologies in emerging economies. China, one of the major distributors of head-mounted VR devices and other hardware, is forecasted to have the highest market share in the region. Simultaneously, Europe is the early adopter of virtual solutions in the automotive industry and will be experiencing significant growth, with Germany and the UK as its leading markets.
How is Virtual Reality Transforming Today's World?
The virtual reality devices used today have their foundation laid on the first head-mounted augmented reality display ""The Sword of Damocles"" which was introduced by Ivan Sutherland in 1968. While firms such as Sega and Nintendo developed VR gaming systems in the 1980s and 1990s, it was not until the 2010s that high-quality VR headsets boasting powerful graphics and motion-tracking technology came to the market.
While gaming has been driving the popularity of VR, the potential of the technology has been realized in a multitude of other industries. The American shipping company UPS committed to millions for the advanced training of its drivers, with the firm’s industry-leading training powered by the use of virtual reality in an industrial training environment. Before drivers operate an actual delivery vehicle, the company's Driving Simulator provides realistic driving experiences.
Virtual reality and augmented reality have also penetrated the healthcare sector as they offer transformative opportunities for medical training, patient care, and therapeutic interventions. The treatment domains in which these technologies are used to treat patients are diverse and include pediatric diagnostics and treatments, pain management, mental health, neurological disorders, surgery planning, intraoperative procedures, telemedicine, as well as post-operative and other rehabilitation therapies. The penetration is evident from the fact that the US FDA has authorized 69 medical devices that incorporate augmented reality and virtual reality.
Story Continues
Virtual Reality is also changing the game for the entertainment industry, especially for artists. Fortnite witnessed a record turnout of more than 12 million attendees to its virtual concert featuring the hip-hop superstar Travis Scott in 2020. Therefore, VR applications continue to spread around today’s world. The renowned luxury car manufacturer BMW has materialized virtual reality experiences in the automotive space. The company expanded its revolutionary driving experience with BMW M Mixed Reality which tends to blur the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds through state-of-the-art VR/MR technologies.

20241113,META,"The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.
The president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act — and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech’s future.
Trump hasn’t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He’s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election — and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn’t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.
But Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.
Now, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump’s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech’s major players.
Antitrust regulation
The Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech’s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.

But a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business “more fair.”
It doesn’t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect’s stop at a McDonald’s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.

“The fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,” explained director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.
AI legislation
Generative AI didn’t take the world by storm until well after Trump’s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.

Regulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there’s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.
The Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump’s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden’s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.
However, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.
“We've seen when that happens,” explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. “When that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.”
Trump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn’t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.
The CHIPS Act and tariffs
The second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.
But Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.

While it’s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.
“The CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,” Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.
But during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.
Tariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.
“Hardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,” explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.
“So whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.”
That could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.
Leading the effortwhich is still in its early phasesis a team inside Instagram's advertising division. One source said Threads is anticipated to let a small number of marketers produce and post material on the platform in January.
Threads had about 275 million monthly active users as late as October. During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg observed that Threads daily sign-up count was about one million, each day.
Apart from increasing advertising on Threads, Meta is heavily investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR). Recently, the business debuted ""Orion,"" a sophisticated prototype of holographic AR glasses weighing less than 100 grams and with a wrist-based neural interface. Although the release date is yet unknown, this advancement emphasizes Meta's dedication to next computing systems.
To cut its dependence on outside search sources, Meta is also creating an artificial intelligence-based search engine. Across Meta's platformsincluding WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebookthis new search engine seeks to provide consumers conversational comments to current events.
These projects mirror Meta's larger approach to diversify its products and include cutting-edge technologies into its line of business.

20241113,META,"(Reuters) -Meta Platforms plans to introduce advertisements to its social media app Threads early next year, the Information reported on Wednesday, citing three people with direct knowledge of the plans.
Threads app was launched in July last year as a challenger to X, formerly Twitter, in a bid to win users from the de facto micro-blogging site during its chaotic takeover by billionaire Elon Musk.
The app hit 275 million monthly active users, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last month, a sign of its rapid growth.
Threads is planning to allow a small number of advertisers create and publish ads on the app starting in January, according to the report.
A team inside Instagram's advertising division is leading the initiative, the report said.
Meanwhile, Meta does not expect Threads to be ""a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue,"" CFO Susan Li said on a post-earnings call in October.
She also said that the company plans to introduce more features on the app.
""Since our priority is to build consumer value first and foremost, there are no ads or monetization features currently on Threads,"" a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed response.
Threads could attract advertisers from X at a time when the platform has undergone a drastic change under Musk.
In August, Musk's X sued a global advertising alliance and several major companies, including Mars and CVS Health, accusing them of unlawfully conspiring to boycott the site and causing it to lose revenue.
Ad revenue at X slumped for months after Musk bought the company in 2022. Some advertisers had been wary of ad spending under Musk amid questions and fears that their brands would appear next to harmful content that would have otherwise been removed under prior owners.

A lot has been made of the recent efforts by the United States government to tighten chip exports to China. This coordinated effort, just before Donald Trump takes office, includes stricter license restrictions on US chip firms doing business with China, added scrutiny on those that assemble their hardware in China, and an appeal to allies in Europe and Asia to follow suit. These efforts have only served to further bolster the semiconductor index in China, which leaped to a record high on November 11 amid reports that a recent US order to halt TSM chip supplies to China would accelerate efforts in Beijing to set up advanced chip manufacturing companies in the Asian country.

Chinese brokerage Cinda Securities, in a note published on the China chip situation on November 10, has said that in the medium and long term it will force the reorganization of the supply chain, increase the demand for domestic advanced process production capacity, and promote technological breakthroughs in upstream semiconductor equipment and materials. Many Chinese firms are reliant on TSM chips - 11% of TSM revenue is linked to China - and analysts expect these firms to undergo short-term pain from the US measures, but back them to emerge stronger in the long term due to improvement of domestic chip manufacturing.

20241113,META,"By Jody Godoy
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta Platforms must face trial in a U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit seeking its break-up over claims that it bought Instagram and WhatsApp to crush emerging competition in social media, a judge in Washington ruled on Wednesday.
Judge James Boasberg largely denied Meta's motion to end the case filed against Facebook in 2020, during the Trump administration, alleging that the company acted illegally to maintain its social network monopoly.
Meta, then known as Facebook, overpaid for Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to eliminate nascent threats instead of competing on its own in the mobile ecosystem, the FTC claims.
Boasberg let that claim stand, but dismissed the FTC's allegation that Facebook bolstered its dominance by restricting third-party app developers' access to the platform unless they agreed not to compete with its core services.
""We are confident that the evidence at trial will show that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have been good for competition and consumers,"" a Meta spokesperson said on Wednesday.
FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said that the case filed during the Trump administration and refined under Biden ""represents a bipartisan effort to curtail Meta’s monopoly power and restore competition to ensure freedom and innovation in the social media ecosystem.""
At trial, Meta will not be allowed to argue the WhatsApp acquisition boosted competition by strengthening its position against Apple and Google , Boasberg ruled.
The judge said he would release a detailed order later on Wednesday after the FTC and Meta have had a chance to redact any sensitive commercial information.
A trial date in the case has not been set.
Meta had urged the judge to dismiss the entire case, saying it depended on an overly narrow view of social media markets, and did not take into account competition from ByteDance's TikTok, Google's YouTube, X, and Microsoft's LinkedIn.
The case is one of five blockbuster lawsuits where antitrust regulators at the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice are going after Big Tech.
Amazon.com Inc and Apple are both being sued, and Alphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge recently found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.

20241113,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered solid Q3 2024 results, depicting the company's overall robust revenue growth, ad performance, and engagement across the core platforms. The total revenue for the quarter increased by 19% year over year (YoY) and reached $40.6 billion.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.
This increase was mainly driven by the Family of Apps segment, which greatly contributed to Meta's advertising revenue, comprising Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The third-quarter ad revenues reached $39.9 billion, 19% higher compared to the same period last year, on the back of better-priced ads and higher ad impressions, reflecting Meta's move to monetize the huge users with better ad targeting and AI-powered enhancements.
These improved ad-targeting features are courtesy of Meta's investments in AI, which increased ad relevance and boosted engagement. The result of this AI personalization strategy is three times more effective, which means increasing user retention and engagement: an 8% increase on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram. Central to this strategy was Meta AI, the company's AI assistant, which would make sure to really help tailor content and ads to user preferences while creating a more immersive experience across Meta's platforms.
Geographically, Meta reported strong ad revenue growth in both the Asia-Pacific and European regions, with high user engagement and soaring demand for ad placements. The former enjoys an extensive mobile-first user base that is growing very fast, while the latter has shown great resilience in ad demand against economic challenges. While the U.S. and Canada remain Meta's most profitable markets, growth was relatively slow because of market maturity. This diversified growth across regions underlines Meta's capability to capture new ad revenue streams outside its core North American markets.
AI Powers Meta's Strong Q3 Growth
Source: Meta Earnings
Meta Boosts Profits with Strategic Cost Management and AI Investments Amid Metaverse Ambitions
Additionally, Meta's net income for Q3 was 35% YoY higher, a function not only of revenue growth but also increased profitability through operational efficiencies and disciplined cost management. Its margin stretched to 43% from 40% a year ago despite big continuous investments in AI and Reality Labs, Meta's metaverse-focused business segment. An increase in such a margin would say that Meta is arresting non-core costs effectively while reallocating resources to strategic growth areas.
Reality Labs remains at an early stage, though it is considered a critical piece of Meta's longer-term vision of immersive digital experiences. As a result, it continues to incur significant losses. This quarter, Meta spoke about its long-term goal of developing its metaverse and VR/AR capabilities. Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that this technology would change the way digital interactions are conducted over the long term. While Reality Labs posted a significant operating loss, profitability for Meta as a whole was good enough to digest these costs and showcase the resilience of its core business.
Story Continues
According to marketing expert Dominick Tomanelli, Meta deploys sophisticated AI models by leveraging first-party data and serving up personalized content and targeted ads to drive user experience. Integration of AI tools allows their team to increase user connection through video content creation and recommendation systems with consumers, content creators, and advertisers alike. Another example is investment in AI infrastructure, which should, over time, further underline Meta's commitment to more advanced AI-driven personalization and engagement across all of its platforms.
Meta's $734 Fair Value: High Growth Potential
Meta's fair value of $734, according to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, reflects an optimistic view of its future growth potential, especially in AI and Reality Labs. The model assumes Meta will achieve a high 10-year EPS growth rate of 28.80%, driven by anticipated returns on its massive investments in advanced AI and immersive technology through Reality Labs. Following this growth period, the terminal growth rate slows to 4%, representing a mature phase as the company stabilizes. Revenue is projected to grow at an annual rate of 33%, while free cash flow is expected to increase by 25.30% over the next decade. These growth projections underscore confidence that Meta's AI and metaverse initiatives could significantly boost cash flows if they succeed, transforming the company's financial profile and driving earnings upward.
The DCF model's outcome$734 per sharesuggests a 22.13% margin of safety compared to the current stock price of $572.04, indicating a potentially undervalued position for Meta based on these assumptions. This valuation implies that, despite high upfront costs and some near-term financial pressures, Meta's long-term growth in new, high-potential areas could justify its current premium pricing. The valuation relies on substantial future growth in earnings, revenue, and cash flow, contingent on Meta's ability to monetize its AI and the metaverse ventures. However, this optimistic fair value comes with inherent risks; if growth falls short of these high expectations, the current stock price might prove overvalued. Investors considering Meta should weigh this potential upside against the risk that ambitious growth goals may not fully materialize.
Costly AI, Metaverse Investments Amid Mounting Regulatory Risks
Meta invests in a set of risks, mainly huge capital expenditure and dependency on AI-driven ad revenue. Meta's huge capital expenditure plans are primarily in AI and Reality Labs. Meta increased its guidance for CapEx in 2024 to US$38-40 billion, which might strain cash flow and hurt profitability if these investments do not pay off big. While the focus on AI and metaverse is expected to drive growth for Meta going forward, the near term will likely be a financial burden that presses on the company's margins and free cash flow, particularly because Reality Labs continues to operate at a loss.
Besides, of course, there are regulatory and geopolitical risks. Meta continues under increasing examination in the U.S. and EU regarding data privacy and AI ethics, where any such regulations would impinge on its use of data and raise compliance costs. Geopolitical tensions, especially in regions like the Asia-Pacific, which have shown phenomenal revenue growth for Meta, can disrupt operations or lead to change policies that hurt advertising demand. While prospects for growth may be bright for Meta in many ways, investors will want to consider these risks carefully in light of today's premium valuation and ambitious but expensive investment initiatives taken by the company.
Takeaway
In all, Meta's Q3 2024 earnings highlight that it can effectively balance short-term profitability with long-term growth initiatives. Solid ad revenue growth driven by AI-driven engagement and responsible cost management set Meta well on its path to achieving its ambitious strategy centered on AI and the metaverse.

The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI, now the most valuable private firm in the world, back in November 2022 had widespread implications for the technology industry. In the two years since the release, technology valuations, which had hit a snag due to broader inflation and slowing growth concerns, have jumped back up. Technology giants have surpassed multi-trillion dollar valuations and OpenAI itself has crossed $150 billion in value. In this environment, technology firms have been pushing for greater capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, telling investors that adding more data and computing power will consistently lead to improved AI models.

However, news agency Reuters reports that new techniques being used by AI firms to train their AI models could reshape the AI arms race, and have implications for the types of resources that AI companies have an insatiable demand for, from energy to types of chips. For example, Ilya Sutskever, a Canadian-Israeli computer scientist who was one of the founders of OpenAI, has said that results from scaling up pre-training have plateaued. The computer scientist claims that the 2010s were the age of scaling, and now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again.

There is a lot of debate around potential AI policy changes as Donald Trump prepares to take charge as US president. According to a report by news platform Wired, a Trump administration AI policy would likely prioritize ensuring US leadership in AI development, focusing on competition with China. This strategy, per the report, could involve bolstering federal resources to support massive AI projects and maintaining or intensifying sanctions on Chinese tech companies to restrict their access to critical US technology, like advanced chips essential for training powerful AI models. Trump has promised to repeal the executive order on AI by US President Biden, which was introduced to implement safety measures like preventing algorithmic bias and strengthening federal oversight of AI developments. Critics argue that reversing these policies could lead to less oversight in a rapidly evolving field, potentially increasing risks as AI is deployed more broadly.

Another important development that investors should keep an eye on is the influence of Elon Musk on Trump's policies. Musk aggressively backed Trump during the campaign and his AI startup, xAI, could benefit from friendly Trump policies, per the Wired report. The report also added that the focus on xAI would in turn serve to make OpenAI and Google targets, perhaps threatening the ability of the two firms to secure lucrative future government contracts.

20241113,META,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer was talking about.
Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the market’s reaction to the election results. He noted that the trading session on November 6 was largely influenced by a collective sigh of relief from traders who were glad the election was over. With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office, many were preparing for the shifts his administration could bring. Cramer pointed out that the market responded positively to Trump’s victory, stating:
“The market likes Donald J. Trump and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both and we had a monster-buying celebration. It was a bull jailbreak and the bears never knew what trampled them.”
Cramer reflected on the uncertainty leading up to the election, with many investors fearing a prolonged and contentious process. But with the winner now clear, Cramer argued that the market is better off knowing what lies ahead. He remarked:
“Let’s understand that many people thought we’d have a contested election, which would cause tremendous uncertainty. The fact that we already know the winner is a huge win for the stock market in itself, which makes it a magnet for new money. This election, with its vicious maelstrom of hate and fear, is finally over.”

One of Cramer's main focuses was Trump's proposed tax cuts, which he believes will have a substantial impact on corporate profits. Cramer emphasized that the tax cuts are expected to boost earnings, particularly by lowering corporate tax rates, which would directly increase profit estimates and earnings per share. Cramer also highlighted the importance of maintaining low interest rates for these benefits to materialize.
He cautioned that while the current environment might feel like a party, there could be risks down the line, especially as debt continues to grow. Despite these concerns, Cramer seemed optimistic, suggesting that the market could continue to rally as long as interest rates stay low and corporate tax cuts come to fruition.
However, Cramer also pointed out a potential complication and commented:
“We also have to accept that we will have another earning season right at the time of the inauguration. So we'll have to worry about those earnings too, but not yet.”
Story Continues
Additionally, Cramer suggested that there could be more significant market moves in the near future, especially if President-elect Trump makes comments about the Federal Reserve that investors find unsettling. He said that such remarks could trigger a negative reaction from the market, potentially leading to a downturn before things settle again.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)
Cramer highlighted the chatter around a conflict between Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) Mark Zuckerberg and President-elect Trump and said:
“Big Tech got a real boost, especially the ones that have been hectored by antitrust like Alphabet or Amazon or, or frankly even Apple and maybe even, we thought maybe Nvidia and Meta… I'd also buy Meta here. There's all sorts of bogus scuttlebutt about how the President-elect and Mark Zuckerberg don't get along. I think that's the old days, people. I believe things have gotten better between the two and you should think more about the fundamentals now, which are fabulous… Look, there's some common ground between the two. It was silly that the stock wasn't up as much, but people were worried about the two of them being angry at each other.”
Meta (NASDAQ:META), a global leader in digital connectivity has a massive audience of 3.29 billion daily active users across its platforms. It has become a dominant force in shaping how people communicate and share information online.
After the 2016 U.S. elections, Facebook faced criticism for its role in undermining American democracy. Critics argued that the platform's algorithmic News Feed promoted hyperpartisan content, fake news, and disinformation, including materials seeded by Russian operatives. This was later confirmed by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, who declassified a report in January 2017 detailing Russia's interference.
Initially, its executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, dismissed these concerns, with Zuckerberg even calling it ""pretty crazy"" to suggest that fake news on the platform had influenced the election. However, within 10 months, Zuckerberg acknowledged his earlier comments as dismissive and expressed regret.
The company's involvement in the political sphere continued into the 2020 U.S. presidential election. President-elect Donald Trump’s critique was included in his ""Save America"" coffee table book, where he threatened legal action against Zuckerberg, stating that if the company engaged in any illegal activity during the 2020 election, Zuckerberg could face lifelong prison time. However, after Trump’s recent victory in the election, Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) Zuckerberg publicly congratulated him, expressing optimism for future collaboration with his administration.

A Meta lawyer told the FTC’s five commissioners at a hearing Tuesday that the consumer protection agency doesn’t have authority to modify the agreement without the company’s consent.
In previous cases, modifications to settlements were “more technical corrections,” Meta lawyer James Rouhandeh said. But as far as large-scale changes, “the commission doesn’t have that authority to do that on its own.”
The commission last year alleged Meta violated terms of the 2020 settlement and sought to open a new proceeding to also ban Meta’s use of facial recognition tools and monetizing children’s data. Meta has been under a privacy consent decree with the FTC since 2012, but agreed to pay $5 billion and operate under stiffer privacy requirements under the 2020 accord with the agency.
The agency didn’t say when it might issue a decision. With the election of Donald Trump as the next US president, his administration could drop the effort to modify Meta’s settlement once it gains a Republican majority at the FTC next year.
The company has filed several legal challenges to the proceeding, both in federal court and before the FTC. Tuesday’s hearing before the FTC’s commissioners involved whether the agency has the authority to modify its orders.
Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, one of the agency’s two Republicans who could become chair in the next administration, raised several questions about why the agency opened an internal proceeding to modify the order terms rather than seeking to hold Meta in contempt in federal court.
“It seems foreign to me to say when someone violates the order, rewrite the order,” Ferguson said, noting that the way the proceeding was structured could lead to a company being “on the hook forever.”
Reenah Kim, a lawyer for the FTC, argued that Congress gave the agency the ability to modify orders in limited circumstances and it has used that power sparingly.

(Reuters) -ValueAct Capital has built a $1-billion stake in Meta Platforms but is not currently pushing for big changes at the Facebook and Instagram parent, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
The stake, which ValueAct has been building in recent weeks, now ranks among the firm's two largest alongside its bet on cloud-based software company Salesforce.
The investment firm and technology company have held discussions but it was not clear at what level and what suggestions were made.
Meta is worth $1.5 trillion and the company's stock price barely moved on the news, which was first reported by CNBC.
The new stake is not considered an activist position in which ValueAct would press management and the board to make dramatic changes, the source said.
Later this week, investment managers will release their 13F filings that show their positions in U.S. stocks at the end of the third quarter and the Meta stake will show up on ValueAct's filing. However, its size has grown dramatically over recent weeks.
ValueAct, based in San Francisco, previously invested in Microsoft, where it wanted the company to improve performance and was then handed a board seat in 2013. Compared with other activist investors, ValueAct prides itself on working with managements and boards outside the limelight and reaching solutions without threatening noisy boardroom challenges.
Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment and ValueAct declined to comment.

One conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC’s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.

Nevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity’s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn’t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.
While that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.
“The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever”.
In light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called ""time testing compute"" for improving models during the “inference” phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.
Recent AI Developments
Fortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry’s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.

In its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn’t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot’s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.
In other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.
“Ad programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.”

20241113,AAPL,"Consumer group Which? has launched a £3 billion claim against Apple, claiming the tech giant has breached competition law by “forcing its iCloud services on customers”.
It says Apple has encouraged users to sign up to iCloud to store photos, videos and other data and is therefore favouring its own products, while simultaneously making it difficult to use alternative products, ultimately stifling competition.
Which? says Apple does not allow customers to store or back up all of their phone’s data with a third-party provider, and users of its iOS operating system have to pay for the service when the amount of data being stored goes over the 5GB free limit.
In its claim, which has been filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal, the consumer group also accuses Apple of overcharging users for iCloud subscriptions, partly because the company’s dominance of the market means it is difficult for new alternatives to emerge and provide competition.
The group said it is seeking damages for all affected Apple customers who have obtained iCloud services since October 1 2015, which it estimates is around 40 million people, and that individual customers could be owed an average of £70, depending on how long they have been paying for the service.
Which? has urged Apple to resolve the claim without the need for litigation by offering consumers their money back, and opening up its operating system to allow users more choice for cloud services.
Apple has been contacted for comment.
Which? chief executive Anabel Hoult said: “We believe Apple customers are owed nearly £3 billion as a result of the tech giant forcing its iCloud services on customers and cutting off competition from rival services.
“By bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations like Apple that they cannot rip off UK consumers without facing repercussions.
“Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future, and create a better, more competitive market.”",0.6552291691938377,"[[ 0.269441   -0.25785762 -0.54584634 ... -0.7144217  -0.8977773

20241113,AAPL,"Intelligent new features, timesaving tools, and new creative options come to Final Cut Pro across Mac, iPad, and iPhone, plus editing for spatial video
CUPERTINO, Calif., November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today unveiled Final Cut Pro® 11 — supercharged with intelligent new features — along with powerful updates to Final Cut Pro for iPad®, Final Cut Camera™, and Logic Pro®. Offering new tools like Magnetic Mask and the highly anticipated Transcribe to Captions, Final Cut Pro 11 for Mac®1 also supports the import, edit, and delivery of spatial video projects directly to Apple Vision Pro™.2
Final Cut Pro for iPad 2.1 advances the touch-first editing experience with support for Enhance Light and Color; new Live Drawing inks; haptic feedback; even more built-in content, including color-grading presets and dynamic soundtracks; and other meaningful workflow improvements.3 Final Cut Camera 1.1, the intuitive pro recording app for iPhone®, adds support for 4K120 fps recording on iPhone 16 Pro, the ability to apply a preview lookup table (LUT) while recording, and capture of Log-encoded HEVC video for smaller file sizes.4 And to supercharge songwriting, beat-making, producing, and mixing, Logic Pro for Mac 11.1 and Logic Pro for iPad 2.1 add support for a new Quantec ™ Room Simulator plug-in.
The new version of Final Cut Pro for Mac and iPad, Final Cut Camera, and Logic Pro for Mac and iPad are available today on the App Store®.
""Our creative apps give artists, producers, directors, and editors around the world the tools they need to express themselves and realize their artistic vision,"" said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple’s senior director of Worldwide Product Marketing for Apps. ""With the power of Apple silicon and state-of-the-art machine learning capabilities, Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro are faster and more intelligent than ever. These latest updates give creative professionals more stylistic interpretations to explore — whether that’s with fine-tuned masking for color grading or amazing sound processing — and greater versatility and efficiency in their workflows.""
Final Cut Pro 11
Final Cut Pro 11 takes full advantage of Apple’s M-series chips, introducing the powerful and intuitive Magnetic Mask; Transcribe to Captions,5 a highly requested feature that provides fast and accurate closed captions; spatial video editing; and a range of timesaving tools and workflow optimizations.
AI-Powered Features
In Final Cut Pro 11, editors can access two all-new AI-powered tools: Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions. With Magnetic Mask, editors can effortlessly isolate people and objects in a video clip without the need for a green screen or more time-consuming rotoscoping. This powerful and precise automatic analysis provides additional flexibility to customize backgrounds and environments. Editors can also combine Magnetic Mask with color correction and video effects, allowing them to precisely control and stylize each project. And with Transcribe to Captions, closed captions can be automatically generated in the timeline using an Apple-trained large language model that transcribes spoken audio.
Story Continues
Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions join existing AI-powered features made possible by Apple’s Neural Engine, including:
Smart Conform to easily make social media-friendly versions of projects in square or vertical formats.
Enhanced Light and Color to automatically improve the color, color balance, contrast, and brightness of video or still images.
Smooth Slo-Mo to generate and blend together frames of video — including footage captured on iPhone 16 Pro in 4K120 fps — for the highest-quality movement.
Voice Isolation to enhance speech and optimize sound levels while reducing background noise from audio captured in the field.
Spatial Video Editing for Apple Vision Pro
Spatial video allows users to capture life’s precious moments and relive them on Apple Vision Pro. Final Cut Pro 11 now supports spatial video editing, allowing editors to import their footage and add effects,6 make color corrections, and enhance their projects with titles. The depth position of titles and captured footage can also be adjusted during the editing process. Spatial video clips can be captured directly with Vision Pro, or on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, and Canon’s new RF-S7.8mm F4 STM DUAL lens paired with Canon R7.7
Users can choose from various viewing modes to preview the left- and right-eye angles on their Mac display. And with Mac Virtual Display™,8 they can bring their edit into Apple Vision Pro, creating an enormous, private, and portable display that’s ideal for complex workflows. Later this year, users will be able to expand Mac Virtual Display to a new panoramic size, creating a massive 32:9 ultrawide curved display that’s equivalent to having two 5K monitors side by side. Spatial videos can be exported directly to a user’s Photos library, viewed immediately on Vision Pro, or shared with others by uploading them to the native visionOS™ Vimeo app.
Timesaving Features, Blazing Speeds, and Pro Creative Tools
Final Cut Pro features advanced editing tools to help streamline creative workflows even further and save time:
Magnetic Timeline, a trackless approach to editing footage, offers a fluid way to trim and edit a project. Editors can add and rearrange clips seamlessly, making adjustments while keeping video and audio perfectly in sync.
With multicam editing, users can instantly sync multiple angles of a project and switch between shots during playback. And new keyboard shortcut options allow users to adjust the view of their timeline and reposition clips.
Optimizations for Apple silicon allow editors to play back more streams of 4K and 8K ProRes ® video at full quality, add playback effects, and share their work with others at blazing speeds.
Editors can create a lightweight copy of their library with enhanced proxy tools, decreasing file sizes to make transfer times even shorter.
Using Compressor, editors can create custom export settings to deliver their work in a wide range of file formats, and import previous stereoscopic footage to reformat and pair with spatial video footage for an integrated editing experience.
Using Motion®, users can create stunning 2D and 3D titles, generators, and advanced visual effects that are accessible within Final Cut Pro.
Final Cut Pro for iPad 2.1
Final Cut Pro for iPad 2.1 brings beloved features to the touch-first editing experience. Powered by Apple silicon, Enhance Light and Color is an intelligent way to improve color, color balance, contrast, and brightness in video or still images in one simple step, and is optimized for SDR, HDR, RAW, and Log-encoded media. With haptic feedback for Apple Pencil Pro™ and Magic Keyboard®, users will feel a light pulse as they trim clips, move media, navigate the timeline, and resize viewer clips to snapping points.
Other meaningful workflow improvements include a new vertical pinch gesture that can expand or minimize clip height in the timeline; the ability to dynamically adjust the size and position of the viewer in Picture in Picture mode; and timeline support for recordings at 90 fps, 100 fps, and 120 fps on iPhone 16 Pro.
New inks for the Live Drawing feature on iPad let users add even more animations to videos with expressive new watercolor, crayon, fountain pen, and monoline pen options. And the content library expands with new modular transitions, color-grading presets, and dynamic soundtracks, along with the ability to easily highlight and overlay visuals with Picture in Picture and Callout effects.
Final Cut Camera
Final Cut Camera 1.1 brings intuitive pro controls for aspiring and professional directors. The update offers users the ability to capture Log-encoded HEVC video in standalone or Live Multicam sessions, so users can take advantage of the amazing dynamic range of Log while benefitting from reduced file sizes and even more recording time. Final Cut Camera also allows users to enable a LUT preview while recording in Log, showcasing the vibrancy of the original scene in SDR or HDR with the Apple Log LUT. With iPhone 16 Pro, users can record beautiful and crisp 4K120 fps footage for even smoother cinematic slow motion, import it into Final Cut Pro for iPad, and begin their edit. A new advanced level helps users precisely compose shots with roll and tilt indicators, and for top-down shots, Final Cut Camera introduces a crosshairs indicator.
Logic Pro for Mac 11.1 and Logic Pro for iPad 2.1
Logic Pro for Mac9 and iPad10 supercharge songwriting, beat-making, producing, and mixing, and are an excellent companion for Final Cut Pro editors. Today, that experience gets even better with the new Quantec Room Simulator plug-in, which allows users to tap into the legendary sound of the most acoustically accurate reverb ever created, built using the original schematics, algorithms, and code from Quantec founder and inventor Wolfgang Buchleitner. Users can select the vintage Quantec QRS to add natural acoustic space to music while preserving sonic character, or the modern Quantec Yardstick for improved clarity and detail. The Quantec QRS technology is a great tool for video editors who want to add natural-sounding spaces to dialog, foley, and music.
""The Quantec Room Simulator has been a key element to my sound for many years, appearing on records like Passion and Us. I also used it to build harmonic drones to start my live set, which then evolved into songs like ‘Across the River,’"" said musician Peter Gabriel. ""It’s wonderful that Apple is bringing the Quantec QRS back to life as a plug-in for Logic users around the world.""
With Reorder Mixer Channels, users can rearrange channel strips by dragging them, and can even select multiple channel strips to reorder them collectively. To make it easier to find and add any plug-in directly using a keyboard command, Logic Pro for Mac users can now search by category, company name, or even part of a plug-in name. Logic Pro for iPad also introduces Sample Folders, giving users access to their personal collection of samples directly from the built-in Sound Browser right from iPad, external storage, and iCloud ® Drive.

20241113,AAPL,"The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.
The president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act — and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech’s future.
Trump hasn’t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He’s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election — and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn’t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.
But Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.
Now, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump’s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech’s major players.
Antitrust regulation
The Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech’s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.

But a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business “more fair.”
It doesn’t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect’s stop at a McDonald’s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.
Story Continues
“The fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,” explained director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.
AI legislation
Generative AI didn’t take the world by storm until well after Trump’s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.
FILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS
Regulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there’s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.
The Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump’s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden’s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.
However, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.
“We've seen when that happens,” explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. “When that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.”
Trump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn’t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.
The CHIPS Act and tariffs
The second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.
But Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.

While it’s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.
“The CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,” Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.
But during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.
Tariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.
“Hardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,” explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.
“So whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.”
That could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.

Many Americans use the stock market to build wealth and achieve financial freedom. In 2022, roughly 60% of U.S. households had some stock exposure and the share of Americans trading stocks directly rose to 21% from 2001.
But not everyone who invests in stocks becomes wealthy. Investing requires patience, research and wisdom. Let's look at a success story for inspiration and ideas.
In July last year, an investor shared his success story, detailed portfolio and tips on r/Dividends, a discussion board on Reddit with over 600,000 members.
Don't Miss:
These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends
Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.
From $25k to $438K Portfolio and $20,000 in Dividends
The investor said he started investing at the age of 44 with $25,000. At the time of his post, he was 50 and his portfolio value had reached $438,000.
But that's not it. He had about $20,100 in estimated dividend income from his portfolio.
""Wish I’d have started when I was 20, I’d be retired now. Remember it's never too late to start so don't give up,"" he said.
The investor said his income averaged about $60,000 to $100,000 per year, but his expenses were low, at around $2,000 per month. He said he always managed to ""dump"" extra cash in the stock market.
""I sold anything in my home I didn't need and put the money into the portfolio. You'll be surprised what you can sell on FB Marketplace. I also put an ad on Craigslist saying I would take anything for free. I sold some things people gave me for a few hundred $'s and added this to the portfolio.""
Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!
He also shared details on his contributions during the discussion:
""Some years I was able to put away up to $35k per year, other years less. I bought index funds and oil stocks at first; my dividends weren't at the forefront because I didn't know any better.

20241113,AAPL,"This week, Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) gained confidence from analysts, who revised their recommendations and price targets for the stock, suggesting that the Street is bullish on the tech firm.
Apple received more analyst support from its sources, with Monness Crespi & Hardt affirming a buy stance and increasing its target price to $245. Analysts were motivated by Apple's high growth prospects and the continuing diversification of its product offering. This comes while Apple remains one of the most valuable firms in the market, with constant demand for its flagship devices and a growing services arm.
Robert W. Baird also raised its price target on Apple from $200 to $240. The firm revised its recommendation to outperform, stating that new Apple products, coupled with the firm's leadership in the above-premium smartphone segment, signal continuous revenue growth. According to the firm's analysts, Apple maintains a diverse ecosystem of hardware, software, and services, which they believe will remain instrumental in supporting future earnings.
Moreover, Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating and increased its target price to $273, further solidifying evidence that the company can deliver considerable returns.
These upgrades come as the broader market remains cautious, but they give more credit to Apple and highlight how the company can continue selling its products, even in a credit crunch. Trading at 15.4 times its estimated earnings per share for the next year, the fundamentals for AAPL stock are equally encouraging, positioning it for the next leg higher amid short-term risk factors and long-term opportunities.

20241113,AAPL,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Virtual Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best virtual reality stocks.
Overview of the Global VR Market
Virtual Reality is a computer-generated simulation that allows users to interact with a three-dimensional environment. The four elements that characterize virtual reality and differentiate it from other technologies such as augmented reality and mixed reality are a 3D-simulated environment, immersion, sensory engagement, and realistic interactivity, as revealed by HP.
According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global virtual reality market size was valued at $25.11 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow from $32.64 billion in 2024 to $244.84 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 28.6% during the forecast period (2024-2032).
Region-wise, North America is expected to dominate the global VR market over the forecast period. Another rapidly growing region is Asia Pacific with growth driven by the rising demand for immersive technologies in emerging economies. China, one of the major distributors of head-mounted VR devices and other hardware, is forecasted to have the highest market share in the region. Simultaneously, Europe is the early adopter of virtual solutions in the automotive industry and will be experiencing significant growth, with Germany and the UK as its leading markets.
How is Virtual Reality Transforming Today's World?
The virtual reality devices used today have their foundation laid on the first head-mounted augmented reality display ""The Sword of Damocles"" which was introduced by Ivan Sutherland in 1968. While firms such as Sega and Nintendo developed VR gaming systems in the 1980s and 1990s, it was not until the 2010s that high-quality VR headsets boasting powerful graphics and motion-tracking technology came to the market.
While gaming has been driving the popularity of VR, the potential of the technology has been realized in a multitude of other industries. The American shipping company UPS committed to millions for the advanced training of its drivers, with the firm’s industry-leading training powered by the use of virtual reality in an industrial training environment. Before drivers operate an actual delivery vehicle, the company's Driving Simulator provides realistic driving experiences.
Virtual reality and augmented reality have also penetrated the healthcare sector as they offer transformative opportunities for medical training, patient care, and therapeutic interventions. The treatment domains in which these technologies are used to treat patients are diverse and include pediatric diagnostics and treatments, pain management, mental health, neurological disorders, surgery planning, intraoperative procedures, telemedicine, as well as post-operative and other rehabilitation therapies. The penetration is evident from the fact that the US FDA has authorized 69 medical devices that incorporate augmented reality and virtual reality.
Story Continues
Virtual Reality is also changing the game for the entertainment industry, especially for artists. Fortnite witnessed a record turnout of more than 12 million attendees to its virtual concert featuring the hip-hop superstar Travis Scott in 2020. Therefore, VR applications continue to spread around today’s world. The renowned luxury car manufacturer BMW has materialized virtual reality experiences in the automotive space. The company expanded its revolutionary driving experience with BMW M Mixed Reality which tends to blur the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds through state-of-the-art VR/MR technologies.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184
The tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the world in innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. While the firm is well-reputed for multiple smart devices, it made its entry into VR with the launch of its revolutionary Vision Pro headset at its annual WWDC event in June 2023. Apple Vision Pro extends the experience of one’s go‑to apps and creates new possibilities in entertainment, productivity, gaming, and more.
Apple Vision Pro marked a major development in the VR world as emphasized by top industry executives. The CEO of Taiwanese tech giant HTC Cher Wang saw Apple’s aforementioned move as a validation for the industry and something that would bring more confidence in the global market for VR. Simultaneously, the chief technology officer of Finnish mixed reality startup Varjo Urho Konttori stated:
“Apple’s entrance into XR with Vision Pro is an important moment for our whole industry”
Recently, rumors have revealed that the tech giant is working on an affordable version of Vision Pro mixed reality headset. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple has delayed the production of the cheaper Vision Pro to beyond 2027. However, Apple is reportedly working on an updated version of the Vision Pro with an upgraded M5 processor to be launched in 2025.
For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended September 28, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported revenue of $94.9 billion, a record September quarter revenue driven by iPhone.

20241113,AAPL,"According to Canalys, the third quarter of 2024 brought significant shifts in the global smartphone chipset market. For instance, Mediatek, despite leading in shipments with 119 million units, fell behind Apple (AAPL, Financial) in terms of revenue. The Taiwanese chipset maker recorded $26 billion in revenues, reflecting a year-over-year decline. This suggests that MediaTek may be prioritizing volume over margins, catering to high-demand, low-cost smartphone manufacturers.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with EAF.
In contrast, Apple, which only shipped 54 million chipsets, saw an 11% revenue increase, making it the top vendor in terms of revenue. This is due to the high profit per device from its proprietary chips used exclusively in iPhones, contributing to its superior margins and market position.
However, Huawei's most remarkable growth has come from this company. Its HiSilicon unit saw a staggering 211% year-over-year increase, though from a smaller base. Huawei shipped just 8 million chipsets, generating $7 billion in sales. This success is notable, given the company's ability to thrive despite significant trade restrictions. Huawei's strong position in the Chinese market and its strategic agility were key to navigating these challenges and driving its growth in the chipset sector.

20241113,AMZN,"(Bloomberg Law) -- Mandatory “captive audience” meetings in which companies argue against unionization are illegal, the National Labor Relations Board ruled in a case involving Amazon.com Inc., prohibiting one of employers’ most potent weapons against labor organizing campaigns.

Requiring workers to attend anti-union gatherings violates federal labor law protections that allow workers to freely choose whether, when, and how to participate in a debate about union representation—including refraining from doing so, the NLRB’s Democratic majority held in its Wednesday ruling.
“Ensuring that workers can make a truly free choice about whether they want union representation is one of the fundamental goals of the National Labor Relations Act,” Chair Lauren McFerran (D) said in a statement. “Captive audience meetings—which give employers near-unfettered freedom to force their message about unionization on workers under threat of discipline or discharge—undermine this important goal.”
While the board majority handed unions a major victory with its captive audience ban, that win may be fleeting as the incoming Trump administration’s NLRB appointees will likely restore employers’ power to force workers to attend those gatherings.
The case stems from a series of mandatory anti-union meetings at Amazon’s Staten Island facility, where workers voted to unionize in 2022.
Amazon has been waging a high-profile battle against worker organizing. The company’s anti-union conduct has drawn rebukes from the NLRB. Amazon has recently taken to suing the agency.
The NLRB’s Wednesday decision overturned its 1948 ruling in Babcock & Wilcox Co., which permitted mandatory anti-union gatherings. The board said its new prohibition on those meetings will apply prospectively only, to accommodate the reliance that employers may have put on the 76-year-old precedent that it struck down.
Viewpoint-Neutral Ban
Mandatory anti-union gatherings interfere with workers’ organizing rights because they coercively demonstrate employers’ economic power by requiring attendance on pain of discipline or discharge, the NLRB said.
The board emphasized that its ruling makes no distinction based on the viewpoint of the speaker—it bars employers from forcing workers to listen to speeches about their organizing rights, whether their bosses urge them to vote for or against a union.
Story Continues
“None of these viewpoints is ‘offensive’ to the Act,” the NLRB said. “What is offensive to the Act, rather, is the employer’s use of its power to require employees to listen to its views—whatever they are.”
The now-banned meetings also disrupt organizing rights because they provide a mechanism for companies to observe their workers as they listen to managers address the exercise of organizing rights, the board said. Workers who speak out or ask questions will be noticed by their employers and might fear that they’ve exposed themselves to reprisal, according to the ruling.
Employer Safe Harbor
The NLRB established a “safe harbor” from liability for employers that want to speak to workers about labor organizing. To take advantage of that protection, companies need to give employees advance notice that they intend to speak about unionization at voluntary meetings, that workers can leave the meetings without adverse consequences, and that attendance won’t be recorded.
Republican NLRB member Marvin Kaplan dissented from the ruling, saying the board’s ban on captive-audience speech violates the First Amendment.
“Here, the conflict between the majority’s prohibition of captive-audience speeches and the Constitution is manifest and irreconcilable,” Kaplan said.
The NLRB majority decided against retroactive application of its captive audience ban and didn’t fault Amazon for holding meetings that were lawful at the time.
But the board ruled that Amazon committed several other unfair labor practices in its bid to resist unionization, including selectively enforcing a solicitation policy, threatening employees with discipline, and warning workers that it would withhold improvements to wages and working conditions if they vote for the union.
Amazon intends on appealing, said a company spokesperson who called the decision “wrong on the facts and the law.”
“Meetings like this are held by many companies because the decision about whether or not to join a union is an important one, and employees deserve to understand the facts so they can make an informed choice,” Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said in a statement.
The case is Amazon.com Services LLC, N.L.R.B., Case 29-CA-280153, 11/13/24.

20241113,AMZN,"By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - Amazon.com made unlawful promises and threats during mandatory meetings to discourage unionizing at a New York City warehouse, a U.S. labor board said on Wednesday while banning employers from holding such meetings moving forward.
The National Labor Relations Board said that so-called ""captive audience meetings,"" which have been legal for decades and are routine during union campaigns, illegally interfere with workers' rights to freely choose whether or not to unionize.
Employers can lawfully hold meetings to discuss unionizing if they are voluntary, workers are given advance notice of subjects to be discussed, and no attendance records are kept, said the board, whose members are appointed by the president. The board currently has a majority of Democratic appointees.
The NLRB said that Amazon managers solicited grievances and made implied promises to remedy them if workers rejected the union during mandatory meetings at the Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8 ahead of a 2022 union election. At other meetings, managers illegally threatened to withhold raises and benefits if the warehouse unionized, according to the decision.
Amazon also removed union-related posts on an internet message board and threatened to discipline a JFK8 employee if she re-posted them, the board found. Workers at the warehouse ultimately voted to join the Amazon Labor Union, making it the first and so far only Amazon facility to unionize.
Amazon and the union did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The board ordered Amazon to post a notice of the violations at the Staten Island warehouse.
Amazon can appeal the decision to a federal appeals court, which would add to a series of court battles between the e-commerce giant and the labor board.
Amazon has filed two lawsuits claiming the NLRB's structure is unconstitutional, joining a number of other companies including Elon Musk's SpaceX. Amazon's cases seek to block labor board proceedings against the company, including claims that it has illegally refused to bargain with the union at JFK8.
The NLRB's ban on captive audience meetings is likely to face legal challenges by employers, including claims that the ban violates businesses' free-speech rights.
The decision could also be overturned by the board when it gains a Republican majority, as the agency often reverses itself after changes in leadership. President-elect Donald Trump could have a Republican-led board in place as soon as next year.
At least 10 U.S. states including New York, California, and most recently Alaska have banned captive audience meetings or prohibited employers from disciplining workers who do not attend them.

20241113,AMZN,"The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.
The president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act — and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech’s future.
Trump hasn’t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He’s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election — and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn’t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.
But Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.
Now, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump’s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech’s major players.
Antitrust regulation
The Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech’s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.

But a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business “more fair.”
It doesn’t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect’s stop at a McDonald’s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.
Story Continues
“The fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,” explained director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.
AI legislation
Generative AI didn’t take the world by storm until well after Trump’s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.
FILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS
Regulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there’s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.
The Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump’s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden’s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.
However, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.
“We've seen when that happens,” explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. “When that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.”
Trump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn’t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.
The CHIPS Act and tariffs
The second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.
But Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.

While it’s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.
“The CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,” Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.
But during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.
Tariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.
“Hardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,” explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.
“So whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.”
That could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.

20241113,AMZN,"Amazon (AMZN)has launched a low-cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced at under $20, an effort to compete with discount retailers that have increasingly encroached on the e-commerce giant's turf.
In a blog post on Wednesday, the company said the new Amazon Haul storefront will mostly feature products that cost less than $10 and offer free delivery on orders over $25. Amazon plans to ship the products to U.S. customers from a warehouse it operates in China, according to documentation the company provided to sellers. Amazon said Haul orders could arrive within one to two weeks.
Many of the available products on the storefront Wednesday resembled the types of items typically found on Shein and Temu, the China-founded e-commerce platforms that have grown in popularity in recent years.

Shein’s core customers are young women enticed by the low-cost apparel sold on the site. Temu offers clothing, accessories, kitchen gadgets and a broad array of other products for bargain-hungry shoppers.
Temu and Shein often get criticism over the environmental impact of the ultra-fast fashion business model the two companies follow. They have also faced scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and abroad over other issues, including some of the products on their platforms.
Amazon’s new storefront, which is only available on its shopping app and mobile website, features unbranded products, such a phone case and a hairbrush that cost $2.99, and a sleeveless dress that retails for $14.99. The company is seeking to drive home its message on value, with banners on its page advertising “crazy low prices” and activewear “that won’t stretch your budget.”
“Finding great products at very low prices is important to customers, and we continue to explore ways that we can work with our selling partners so they can offer products at ultra-low prices,” Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon’s vice president of Worldwide Selling Partner Services, said in a statement. “It’s early days for this experience, and we’ll continue to listen to customers as we refine and expand it in the weeks and months to come.”
To be sure, importing goods out of China could soon become more expensive for Amazon. In September, the Biden administration said it was cracking down on cheap products sold out of China, a move designed to reduce U.S. dependence on Beijing but could also trigger higher prices for the U.S. consumers who have flocked to Shein and Temu. President-elect Donald Trump has also proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China.

Amazon announced other news this week.
The company said it was shutting down its free, ad-supported streaming service Freevee and consolidating the content under Prime Video, which now also features ads for Prime members who refuse to pay extra to avoid them.
The Seattle-based tech company confirmed Wednesday that it will phase out Freevee in the coming weeks, a move that it says is intended to “deliver a simpler viewing experience for customers.” All Freevee content that’s currently streaming on Prime Video will be labeled “Watch for Free” so both Prime and non-Prime members can easily see what’s available for free, the company said.
“There will be no change to the content available for Prime members, and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.

20241113,AMZN,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is making it harder for disabled employees to get permission to work from home, underscoring the tech giant’s determination to get its corporate workforce back to the office five days a week.

The company recently told employees with disabilities that it was implementing a more rigorous vetting process, both for new requests to work from home and applications to extend existing arrangements. Affected workers must submit to a “multilevel leader review” and could be required to return to the office for monthlong trials to determine if accommodations meet their needs.
The revised disability policy — which hasn’t previously been reported — is roiling a workforce already alienated by a five-day return-to-office mandate that’s scheduled to begin in January.
Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy says the return-to-office requirement will strengthen the company’s culture, which he believes has suffered since the pandemic and become overly bureaucratic. But the policy made Amazon a tech industry outlier and is seen by some employees as a way to get people to quit and shrink the workforce.
Amazon has denied having an ulterior motive and says the new disability policy reflects its broader return-to-office philosophy.
“We understand that this is going to be a transition and we’re working with our employees to make it as easy as possible,” Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said in a statement. “We continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant. When in-person accommodations are needed, we’ll provide them, and in some cases, offer an exception to working from the office.” She declined to say how many requests have been approved.
The Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to make “reasonable accommodations,” including service animals, reserved parking spaces and closed-captioned meetings, to help disabled employees do their jobs. But there are no hard and fast rules guaranteeing such workers the right to work remotely, giving Amazon leverage to call them back to offices even if they’ve been working successfully from home.
Affected employees are receiving calls from “accommodation consultants” who explain how the new policy works. They review medical documentation and discuss how effective working from home has been for employees who’ve already received an accommodation as well as any previous attempts to help the person work in the office. If the consultant agrees that the person should be allowed to work from home, another Amazon manager must sign off. If they don’t, the request goes to a third manager.
Story Continues
During a conversation with an employee suffering from a stress disorder, according to a person familiar with the exchange, an accommodation consultant attempted to establish rapport but also asked the person about sensitive medical issues, such as how the person navigates life outside work and how long it takes them to regulate emotions during a panic attack.
Spokesperson Callahan said finding effective work accommodations might entail asking employees questions to understand how they navigate their disabilities outside work.
One employee, who requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from Amazon, said the process is so convoluted that weeks have passed since applying for a disability exception. The employee’s doctor wrote a letter detailing why the worker should be allowed to work from home, and the disability team requested further documentation. The worker described answering a question only to be asked it again by someone else.
Callahan said if a case is complex, it may require clarification questions and take more time to finalize than others.
Some workers fear the process was designed to make requests less likely to be approved, two employees said. In internal chat rooms, according to one of them, employees have accused Jassy of hypocrisy because the bureaucratic process belies his stated determination to cut through red tape that he says is slowing Amazon down.
In 2023, after the rise of remote work, 22.5% of people with disabilities were employed, the highest percentage since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the metric in 2008. Working from home can benefit people with a range of disabilities, including chronic allergies, limited mobility and anxiety disorders.
Some advocates for the disabled fret that Amazon’s position as the country’s second-largest private employer could influence other companies and erode pandemic-era gains for disabled workers. “It sets a dangerous precedent with other employers,” said Ariel Simms, president and CEO of Disability Belongs, an advocacy group. “Some employees just leave their jobs if the accommodation process is too difficult to navigate.”
Workers denied permission to work remotely can file discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that investigates discrimination claims in the workplace. That would put the burden on Amazon to prove that being in the office is an essential part of a job, said Kenneth Shiotani, a senior staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network.
“That’s the big gray area. How essential is the in-person aspect of the job,” Shiotani said. “There are clearly jobs where being there in person is an essential function. It is much harder to prove in an office, white-collar job since electronic communication is pretty effective.”

20241113,AMZN,"Black Friday is starting more than a week early at Amazon.
The retailer will begin offering holiday deals beginning Nov. 21 this year, with new specials hitting through Nov. 29 (the actual date of Black Friday in 2024). From there, the company plans to get an early start on Cyber Monday, as it will immediately begin offering deals under that banner, which will run through Dec. 2.
The holiday creep has been going on for quite some time, but it’s a bit more understandable this year from a retail perspective. There are only 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve this year, compared to 32 last year. Stores are offering their deep discounts especially early this year to maximize their holiday revenues, which are the most important of the year.
While many of the deals won’t be unveiled until the sale begins, Amazon did offer a few early discounts, as it often does before a big sales event. Included among those were:
Apple AirPods Pro 2 - $190 (orig. $249)
Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum Cleaner, $400 (orig. $570)
Yankee Candle Balsam & Cedar Large Jar Candle, $17 (orig. $31)
Amazon’s also jumping into the Thanksgiving meal deal price wars, offering turkey, side dishes and desserts for six guests at a cost of less than $5 per person.
""The holidays are a time to gather with loved ones, make memories, and create traditions,"" said Carmen Nestares Pleguezuelo, vice president of North America Marketing & Prime Tech at Amazon, in a statement. ""At Amazon, we want to make holiday shopping as convenient and easy as possible.”
Among the deals Amazon will offer during the back-to-back sales are:
Black Friday deals
55% off select Amazon devices, including Ring cameras, Fire TVs and Echo devices.
50% off selected toys from Disney, Marvel and Star Wars
50% off select headphones and earbuds from Beats
Cyber Monday deals
55% off select mattresses from Zinus
50% off Play-doh, Hasbro games and Nerf

20241113,AMZN,"An ill-informed investor can lose cash if he wagers on a stock only based on the numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a must for a better investment decision, especially at a time when the stock market is juggling myriad issues.

Often, investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the coverage ratio comes into play — the higher the metric, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.

Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, Leidos Holdings, Inc. LDOS, Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.
Why Interest Coverage Ratio?
The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.

Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.

Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.

Interest coverage ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.

An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.
The Winning Strategy
Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.

Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry Median

Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.

5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks with a strong EPS growth history.

Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.

Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.

Here are four of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening:

Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is preparing to introduce its newest artificial intelligence chips in December. His strategic move aims to leverage Amazon’s significant investments in semiconductors and reduce reliance on Jensen Huang’s Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA).

What Happened: Amazon’s cloud division is focusing on custom chip development to boost data center efficiency and cut costs for itself and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients. The initiative is spearheaded by Annapurna Labs, a chip start-up acquired by Amazon in 2015 for $350 million. The upcoming “Trainium 2” AI chips are designed for training large models and are already being tested by companies like Anthropic, Databricks, and Deutsche Telekom, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.
Trending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date.
Dave Brown, AWS’s VP of compute and networking services, highlighted the significance of offering an alternative to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI processor market.
""We want to be absolutely the best place to run Nvidia,"" he said. ""But at the same time we think it's healthy to have an alternative.""
Amazon’s capital spending is expected to reach $75 billion in 2024, with a large portion dedicated to tech infrastructure, up from $48.4 billion in 2023, reflecting the AI investment trend among major cloud providers.

Why It Matters: Amazon’s move to launch new AI chips is part of a broader strategy to strengthen its position in the AI market. The company is reportedly considering a second multi-billion-dollar investment in AI startup Anthropic, which utilizes Amazon’s cloud services for training. This follows an initial $4 billion investment last year, with Amazon encouraging Anthropic to use its chips.
In October, Amazon signed a five-year deal with Databricks to provide cost-effective AI-building capabilities, positioning its Trainium AI chips as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs.

20241113,AMZN,"The ex-spouse of Amazon (AMZN, Financial) founder Jeff Bezos, MacKenzie Scott, sold 11% of her total Amazon shares, which decreased her wealth from $38 billion to almost $30 billion. As of 2019, Scott, who took possession of a 4% stake in Amazon after the divorce, has remained a top philanthropist in the U.S. and is one of the five biggest living donors. Forbes Media says she donated about $17.3 billion to nonprofit and humanitarian organizations.

Also, in October, she gave $15m to Coastal Enterprises, a Maine-based organization that supports rural development.
Scott made her pledge in 2019, promising to contribute at least 50 percent of her fortune within her generation. She has also been credited for her philanthropy and continues with this consistent method of making big, targeted donations.

20241113,NFLX,"Disney DIS is a stock Wall Street will be watching closely this week with the media conglomerate set to release results for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday, November 14.
With Disney shares up a respectable +13% year to date, investors may be wondering if there is more upside ahead as earnings approach.
Disney’s Q4 Expectations
Disney’s Q4 sales are expected at $22.59 billion, a 6% increase from $21.24 billion in the comparative quarter. More intriguing, Disney’s cost-saving initiatives appear to be working with Q4 earnings projected to increase 33% to $1.09 per share versus EPS of $0.82 a year ago.
Exceeding earnings expectations for seven consecutive quarters, Disney has posted an impressive average EPS surprise of 18.01% in its last four quarterly reports. Disney has exceeded top line estimates in two of the last four quarters with an average sales surprise of 1.05%.
Zacks Investment Research

Disney’s Streaming Memberships
Reductions to its workforce and reduced operating costs among its streaming segments have been the main catalyst for Disney's increased probability.
EPSN+ subscribers are expected at 25.73 million with Disney+ users forecasted at 120 million. However, Disney+ subscribers would reflect a noticeable dip from the 150 million paid members in the same period last year. Still, when including Hulu subscribers which are projected at 51 million, Disney is edging toward 200 million total streaming memberships.
This is second to streaming leader Netflix NFLX who recently reported over 280 million paid memberships in October.
Monitoring Disney’s Valuation
At around $102, Disney’s stock trades at 19.2X forward earnings which is a nice discount to the S&P 500’s 25.3X and Netflix’s 41.4X.
Furthermore, DIS trades at the optimum level of less than 2X sales compared to the S&P 500’s 5.4X and Netflix’s 9X.
Zacks Investment Research

Takeaway
Disney's Q4 results will be crucial to reconfirming the company’s return to growth as its stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That said, long-term investors could certainly be rewarded given Disney’s appealing valuation with the Average Zacks Price Target of $114.92 a share suggesting 14% upside for DIS.

20241113,NFLX,"Cable news took a major ratings hit on election night, a stark reminder of an industry struggling amid a mass shift towards streaming and alternative media.
“There isn't a media executive that doesn't know that there's a problem. There isn't a media executive that isn't actively working on that problem,” former CNN CEO Chris Licht told me at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Tuesday.
“The facts are that people have lost trust in legacy media,” Licht added. The media veteran was the head honcho at CNN from May 2022 to June 2023.
How to fix the issue is the multibillion-dollar question facing the nation’s most powerful news executives, as growing distrust is one of several factors contributing to the industry’s steady ratings decline.
Nielsen data showed TV viewership of the presidential election coverage fell by a quarter from four years ago, with the three largest cable news networks — CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News — all reporting a drop from 2020.
Former CNN CEO Chris Licht (left) with Yahoo Finance anchor Seana Smith (right) at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Nov. 12, 2024.
Recent executive commentary and Q3 results have further highlighted the massive challenges in the industry. Paramount (PARA) reported continued declines in its linear TV business in the third quarter, while Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) saw a 3% year-over-year decline in revenue, fueled in part by cord cutting.
The decreasing viewership has prompted media giants to rethink the strategy surrounding their linear networks.
Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Licht’s former boss, said on his company’s earnings call last week that he’s exploring ""all things operationally and strategically"" to ensure shareholder value.
One of the options long speculated by Wall Street: a potential spinoff. Recent analysis from Bank of America explored a possible split of WBD’s streaming and studio businesses from its traditional linear TV division.

Crypto surge partially reflects less trust in government: Economist Judy Shelton
Anheuser-Busch InBev CEO: Bud Light sales are stable
And WBD is far from the only legacy media business that could be headed for a split. Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst Geetha Ranganathan recently told me on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief that “we can expect to see more consolidation” across the industry.
“If there's any sector that is in need of consolidation, it really is the media sector,” Ranganathan said. “There are just so many headwinds right now that are affecting the sector, especially as consumers are migrating in droves away from the linear TV model to the streaming model.”

Despite the increase in cord-cutting and the seemingly inevitable consolidation wave, Licht still believes the cable industry will survive. The networks that adapt successfully won't only see a boost to their bottom lines, but will significantly help society, he said.

“It will absolutely decline … but I think there's a floor. I don't think that one day you're going to wake up and there are zero cable subscriptions,” Licht said.
“Can legacy media reinvent itself in a way that then can reconnect with people and become relevant in their lives again and become trusted? I don't know ... For the people that figure it out, there’s a lot of economic upside, [and upside] for our society,” Licht added.

20241113,NFLX,"Two Reasons to Watch Netflix and One to Stay Cautious
Since November 2019, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of 92.7%. But one standout stock has more than doubled the market - over the past five years, Netflix has surged 191% to $822.90 per share. The party hasn’t stopped as it’s also gained 33.5% in the last six months, beating the market by 19.1%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the performance may have investors wondering how to approach the situation.
Is NFLX’s stock a buy right now? Or is the market overestimating its value?
Find out in our full research report, it's free.
Two Reasons We Like Netflix
Launched by Reed Hastings as a DVD mail rental company until its famous pivot to streaming in 2007, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is a pioneering streaming content platform.
1. EBITDA Margin Reveals a Well-Run Organization
Investors frequently analyze operating income to understand a business’s core profitability. Similar to operating income, EBITDA is the most common profitability metric for consumer internet companies because it removes various one-time or non-cash expenses, offering a more normalized view of profit potential.
Netflix has been a well-oiled machine over the last two years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a consumer internet business, boasting an average EBITDA margin of 24.2%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it’s a show of well-managed operations if they’re high when gross margins are low.
Netflix EBITDA Margin
2. Free Cash Flow Margin Increased, Juicing Financials
Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.
Taking a step back, we can see that Netflix’s margin expanded by 18.4 percentage points over the last three years. This is encouraging because its free cash flow profitability rose more than its operating profitability, suggesting it’s becoming a less capital-intensive business. Its free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 19%.
Netflix Free Cash Flow Margin
One Reason To Stay Cautious: Customer Spending Decreases… Engagement Falling?
Average revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Netflix because it measures how much the average user spends. ARPU is also a key indicator of how valuable its users are (and can be over time).
Story Continues
Netflix’s ARPU fell over the last two years, averaging 1.4% annual declines. This isn’t great, but the increase in global streaming paid memberships is more relevant for assessing long-term business potential. We’ll monitor the situation closely; if Netflix tries boosting ARPU by taking a more aggressive approach to monetization, it’s unclear whether users can continue growing at the current pace.
Netflix ARPU
Final Judgment
There are definitely things to like about Netflix, and with its shares topping the market in recent months, the stock trades at 29x forward EV-to-EBITDA, or $822.90 per share. Is now a good time to buy?

Top Stock Reports for Netflix, Salesforce and Cisco
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Netflix, Inc., Salesforce, Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, BK Technologies Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Netflix’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past two years (+169.1% vs. +77.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that the planned launch of an in-house ad tech platform next year signals the company's commitment to maximize its revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year in 2025. A robust, localized and foreign-language content lineup and healthy customer engagement levels have helped.
However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ remains a headwind.

Salesforce’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer – Software industry over the past year (+58.7% vs. +21.3%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving growth. Continued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. Salesforce’s strategy of continuous expansion of generative AI offerings are also helping it to tap the growing opportunities in the space.
Yet, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Softening IT spending amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties might hurt its growth prospects.

Shares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the last six months (+20.4% vs. +19.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, the launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, has strengthened the company’s security portfolio. Also, its business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of total revenues.
Story Continues
Yet, Cisco has been suffering from sluggish networking sales as well as stiff competition. Its prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition aggravated by Hewlett Packard’s deal to acquire Juniper.

BK Technologies’ shares have outperformed the Zack Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+119.5% vs. +52.3%). The Zacks analyst believes that the growing demand for BKR 9000 and BKR 5000 radios have supported revenue growth. Also, a large order backlog and focus on innovation, such as the patented InteropONE solution, strengthens BK's market position.
However, reliance on government contracts, supply-chain risks and limited product diversification pose potential challenges.

To Buy Or Not To Buy: Disney Ahead of Q4 Earnings
The Walt Disney Company is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Nov. 14.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $22.59 billion, suggesting modest growth of 6.37% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.
The consensus mark for earnings has moved south by a penny to $1.09 per share over the past 30 days, indicating growth of 32.93% year over year.
Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.
In the last reported quarter, Disney delivered an earnings surprise of 15.83%. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.01%.

Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Disney this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
DIS has an Earnings ESP of -1.63% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Factors Shaping Upcoming Results
As the media landscape shifts from traditional linear TV to streaming, Disney finds itself in an enviable position. With two robust U.S. streaming services, Disney+ and Hulu, complemented by ESPN+, the entertainment giant is well-equipped to navigate this transition seamlessly.
One of Disney's key advantages is its bundling strategy, which combines these streaming services into a compelling package. This approach is not only expected to have boosted average revenue per account in the to-be-reported quarter but is also likely to have helped reduce customer churn.
In the fiscal fourth quarter, Disney expects Disney+ Core subscribers to grow modestly. The company remains optimistic projecting profitability of the combined streaming businesses to improve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, with both Entertainment DTC and ESPN+ expected to be profitable in the quarter.
Story Continues
However, DIS is likely to have suffered from a persistent decline in Linear TV revenues, which is expected to have negatively impacted Media and Entertainment Distribution revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.
Our model estimates for Entertainment revenues (which include Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing and Other Revenue) are pegged at $9.44 billion, indicating a decrease of 0.8% year over year.
DIS’ true strength lies in its unparalleled portfolio of Intellectual Property (IP). From the iconic Marvel and Star Wars franchises to the beloved Disney princesses, Mickey Mouse and Pixar's timeless classics, the company owns the most powerful collection of IPs in the media industry. This wealth of IP is a significant asset, as it gives audiences an immediate connection to the content, reducing the risk associated with content investments.
The company's extensive library of IP not only fuels its studio operations but also underpins its entire business ecosystem, including streaming, linear networks and the profitable Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products segment.
In the Experiences segment, DIS expects that the demand moderation it saw in domestic businesses in the fiscal third quarter could impact the next few quarters. While the company is actively monitoring attendance and guest spending and aggressively managing the cost base, Disney expects the Experiences segment’s operating income to decline by mid-single digits compared with the prior year, reflecting these underlying dynamics as well as impacts at Disneyland Paris from a reduction in normal consumer travel due to the Olympics and some cyclical softening in China.
As we discuss the quarter under review, investors should pay close attention to key metrics, such as park attendance, per-capita spending and any announcements regarding expansion plans, particularly in international markets. The performance of this segment might have provided a strong foundation for Disney's overall growth trajectory.
Our model estimate for the Experiences segment (renamed from Disney Parks, Experiences and Products) revenues is $9.13 billion, indicating 12% growth year over year.
Despite experiencing strong demand at Disney Cruise Line in the quarter under review, results in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to reflect pre-launch expenses for Disney Adventure and Disney Treasure.
Price Performance & Valuation
Shares of DIS have returned 11.7% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 10%. Disney operates in a fiercely competitive streaming market dominated by the likes of Amazon-owned Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, as well as the growing prominence of services from Apple, Comcast -owned Peacock and HBO Max.
Valuation-wise, Disney is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 19.53X compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s 19.11X, reflecting a stretched valuation. The company’s debt balance of $47.5 billion compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and its current marketable investment securities balance of $5.95 billion.
Investment Considerations: Balancing Risk and Reward
Disney remains a prominent name in the investment world, long revered as a blue-chip stock and a staple in many portfolios. DIS' strength lies in its globally recognized brand and diverse intellectual properties spanning movies, TV shows, theme parks and merchandise. This diverse portfolio has historically given Disney a unique edge in captivating audiences worldwide and generating consistent revenue streams.
However, recent years have brought significant challenges, including disruptions in traditional media, pandemic impacts on theme parks and evolving consumer behaviors. These headwinds have prompted investors to reevaluate Disney's appeal, questioning whether the Magic Kingdom can maintain its former allure in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing entertainment landscape.
Final Thought
Disney remains a diversified media and entertainment powerhouse with a strong brand and valuable intellectual property. Its theme parks and resorts continue to be a significant revenue driver, and the potential for growth in emerging markets of Asia remains promising. However, the accelerating trend of cord-cutting continues to put pressure on this segment, potentially offsetting gains in other areas.
For those considering how to play Disney stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, a nuanced approach may be warranted. Investors with a shorter investment horizon may want to exercise caution and wait for a better entry point, given the uncertainties surrounding the company's growth prospects and the competitive pressure it faces despite the enduring power of the Disney brand.

20241113,NFLX,"Netflix might have been slow to join the ranks of ad-supported streaming services, but it has quickly become a dominant player in that market.
The company on Tuesday announced its ad-supported tier has reached 70 million monthly active users in just two years. Over 50% of new Netflix sign-ups are for the advertising-supported plan, the company said.
Netflix launched its ad-supported tier in November of 2022 to counter slowing subscriber numbers. It not only worked then; it's continued to work, and Netfllix says it continues “to see positive momentum and growth across all areas of the business.”
Advertisers are following those crowds. Netflix said both of the two live Christmas Day NFL games it will air in December have sold out of all available in-game inventory. And upcoming anticipated series, like Squid Game 2, have lured new partners as well.
That could set the company up for even more growth in 2025, when it will begin airing WWE’s flagship Raw program on Mondays. Raw is consistently one of the top-rated programs on cable today and many of those advertisers could follow the brand to Netflix.
Netflix self-reports viewership, but said it has partnered with Nielsen for live ratings of the Christmas Day games. It’s unclear if the two companies will work together on upcoming live programming.
To put the 70-million figure into perspective, Apple TV Plus has a total membership estimated at just 25 million. Peacock stands at 34 million and Hulu has 51.1 million members.
Netflix, all totaled, has over 282.7 million subscribers around the world. The company says it plans to stop reporting subscription numbers starting next year, saying time spent with the service is its “best proxy for customer satisfaction.”

20241113,NFLX,"(Reuters) -Netflix said on Tuesday its ad-supported tier had reached 70 million monthly active users globally, nearly doubling from about six months earlier as customers seek more affordable options.
The plan, priced at $6.99 per month in the U.S., now accounts for more than half of all new Netflix sign-ups in regions where it is available. It reached 40 million global monthly active users in May.
Netflix's cheapest plan without commercials costs $15.49 a month.
Some analysts have previously suggested Netflix should raise prices on its ad-free options to nudge customers towards the tier with commercials as it usually brings in more revenue per user.
Netflix does not offer details on the ad-supported plan's financial performance and does not expect it to become a primary driver of growth until 2026. The tier has been priced the same since its launch in late 2022.
The company also said on Tuesday it had signed FanDuel on as an exclusive pre-game sports betting partner for its Christmas Day National Football League (NFL) games.
""This custom segment will include Netflix Christmas Gameday talent, offering analysis and predictions aligned to FanDuel's wagering odds for the games,"" the company said.
All available in-game ad inventory for the two live NFL games had sold out and Netflix has partnered with advertisers including Verizon Communications.
The company also said Canada had become the first country operating solely on Netflix's ad tech. It is aiming to roll out the tech globally throughout 2025.
Shares of Netflix were up 1.1% in early trading.

Netflix said it had sold out of the in-game inventory for its live NFL Christmas Day games this year, with sponsors that include sports betting company FanDuel and Verizon. The streamer has partnered with Nielsen to provide live ratings for the games.
Netflix also said it had sold ads across its scripted programs, including the anticipated second season of the Korean drama ""Squid Game.""

The company said that more than half of new sign-ups in countries where Netflix offers ads are for the cheaper ad-subscription tier.
""There has been continuous momentum over the last two years, but we’re just getting started and can’t wait to see what’s to come,"" Amy Reinhard, president of advertising, said in a blog post.
Netflix began offering a cheaper ad subscription plan in November 2022 after the streamer saw its subscriber growth decline earlier that year. In the U.S., Netflix with ads costs $6.99 a month, compared with ad-free options that start at $15.49 a month.
At first, Netflix’s ad-supported tier was powered by Microsoft’s technology through a partnership, but the streamer is transitioning to using its own in-house ad technology, which will make it function independently from third parties.
The ad-supported tier was part of a broader push to diversify Netflix's offerings and boost revenue. In addition to commercials, Netflix has started streaming live events, cracking down on password-sharing and promoting games on its platform.
This week, Netflix will up its live sports ambitions with a boxing match between former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and influencer-turned-fighter Jake Paul.
Netflix in the third quarter added 5 million subscribers, bringing its total to about 283 million globally.

20241113,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Shares of this internet video service have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has gained 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.1% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 points to a change of +64.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.5%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.3%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Netflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.
Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Netflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

20241113,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX) said Tuesday that its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users — a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.
The ad plan now accounts for over 50% of all Netflix sign-ups in markets where it's offered.
""There has been continuous momentum over the last two years, but we’re just getting started and can’t wait to see what’s to come,"" Amy Reinhard, president of advertising at Netflix, said in a blog post.
Reinhard noted that recent shows like ""Nobody Wants This,"" ""The Diplomat,"" and ""Monsters: The Erik and Lyle Menendez Story,"" along with live streaming events like the upcoming Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, have been ""driving even more fandom and conversation — which our advertisers love.""

Of note: Monthly active users, otherwise known as MAUs, are not the same as paying subscribers. The company has yet to reveal actual subscriber figures for the ad tier or how much revenue it's generated so far. MAUs can include multiple people using the same account.
The update comes after the streaming platform beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs.
The stock is up more than 60% since the start of the year, and many analysts are calling Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.
Still, Netflix recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to the company's ability to raise prices and boost growth. And some analysts are concerned that the company's valuation is high.
""With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.
""Netflix’s stock is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025,"" Fishman added. Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% to 13% in 2025.

In addition to its ad-tier update, the company also revealed it's sold out of all available in-game ad inventory for its two NFL live Christmas Day games and has partnered with multiple advertisers including Verizon (VZ) and Flutter's (FLUT) FanDuel, among others.
FanDuel is set to be the exclusive pregame sportsbook betting partner for the games, the company revealed. All partners will run traditional ad commercials throughout the live event.

Meanwhile, Netflix has partnered with Nielsen for live ratings of the games. To ensure better accuracy, Netflix will collaborate on first-party streaming data. Earlier this month, Nielsen won approval to incorporate first-party streaming data into its TV measurement calculations.

20241113,NVDA,"SoundHound AI (SOUN) shares nosedived after the company, backed by chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), reported quarterly results beating analysts' estimates but showing declining margins. SoundHound AI Co-Founder and CEO Keyvan Mohajer joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the company's products — which offers its AI-powered voice platform to enterprise customers — earnings results, and growing customer base.
Mohajer tells Yahoo Finance that the company ""had a great quarter,"" passing the $25 million revenue mark for the first time and delivering a beat and raise. SoundHound narrowed its expected losses for the quarter to $0.04 per share.
He says that SoundHound AI's gross margin was affected by ""short-term temporary impacts"" like acquisition costs that ""should improve over time.""
The CEO says customers from different industries are using its tech: ""We spent more than ten years just in R&D [research and development] to build our own AI models and voice recognition in dozens of languages.

20241113,NVDA,"Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) are fighting two Supreme Court cases this year that they claim will flood the legal system with investor lawsuits if not decided in their favor.
So far, things aren't exactly going their way.
Nvidia’s lawyers made their case before the high court on Wednesday and drew skepticism from justices across the ideological spectrum. The same happened to Meta’s lawyers last week.
“It just seems to me that you're asking us to engage in a kind of analysis that we are not very good at,” Justice Elena Kagan, an appointee by Democratic President Barack Obama, told Nvidia’s lawyer Neal Kumar Katyal.
The outcome of the cases could undermine or embolden future securities fraud litigants.
Nvidia argues that investors who sued the company alleging that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made false statements should be required to present more particular information in their lawsuit about what Huang knew at the time of his statements.
The investors claim that in 2017 and 2018, Huang knowingly departed from Nvidia’s internal company data by misattributing the company’s demand for chips to the video gaming market.

Demand at the time, the investors hypothesized, was actually driven by the more volatile market of cryptocurrency mining. That hypothesis relied on the opinion of a financial analyst who based his conclusion on publicly available documents, rather than Nvidia’s company documents.
“This is a highly technical subject, and I just don't understand how a court is opposed to be evaluating that at the pleading stage,” Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, told Nvidia’s lawyer.
The justices pressed Nvidia to explain why they should reverse a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, repeating a point they made in the case against Meta's Facebook argued last week.
In both cases, the appellate court allowed investors to proceed against the companies with proposed class-action securities fraud suits.
Yale Law School professor Jonathan Macey said he was surprised by the justices’ questions in the Facebook case.
“One thing that was amazing in the oral argument,” he said, “is you've got this kind of across-the-aisle alliance” with conservative Justice Clarence Thomas to liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressing concerns that were “very pro-plaintiff.”
Facebook, for its part, said investors should not be able to allege that it misled its stockholders by omitting that its partnership with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users.
Story Continues
At the core of both disputes are questions about what facts a plaintiff must include in a legal complaint to keep a case in court.
Facebook argued that its disclosures were not false or misleading by failing to disclose that the Cambridge Analytica breach actually materialized in the past, especially because the so-called risk posed no known risk of ongoing or future business harm.

According to Nvidia, investors should not be able to maintain a proposed class-action lawsuit against the company by relying on an expert’s opinion.
“Congress … wanted to stop lawsuits like this, lawsuits that allowed for fraud by hindsight,” Katyal said on behalf of Nvidia during Wednesday’s arguments.
“When a stock drops, all [plaintiffs] have to do is find an expert with numbers that contradict a company's public statements,” Katyal said.
Katyal went on to say that a decision in favor of the shareholders created “an easy road map” for plaintiffs to evade a federal law that requires particular information to be included in a securities fraud complaint.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), which was in part created to prevent frivolous lawsuits, states that a plaintiff must show that a defendant company intended to make a false or misleading statement and that the statement was, in fact, false.
Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, also entertained the idea that the PSLRA may need refining.
Gorsuch said “it beggars belief” to think that a CEO, such as Huang, would have been unaware of the source of such a large portion of the company's income.
Jim Redwood, a securities law professor with Albany Law, doubted that Supreme Court would ultimately rule in favor of the investors, saying he expects both cases to be resolved in a manner that curbs future securities class action lawsuits.
“The Facebook case is somewhat closer,” he said, explaining that the social media company’s case may be somewhat weaker than Nvidia’s.
The Justice Department joined in the Nvidia case, siding with investors.
“We think that the 9th Circuit correctly applied the standard here,” the DOJ’s lawyer said during arguments on Wednesday.

These crypto stocks are poised for strong growth as the Bitcoin price eclipsed $90,000 for the first time.

The cryptocurrency market is on a rally, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting multiple milestones over the past week. Bitcoin started the year on a high, extending its gains from 2023. However, the rally came to a halt in the second quarter. Market experts had predicted that the cryptocurrency still has much potential and the rally would resume in the second half of the year.
The recent rally is being fueled by Donald Trump’s landmark victory in the Presidential election coupled with another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve last week. Given this situation, investing in Bitcoin-centric stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, BlackRock, Inc. BLK and Accenture plc ACN, which have strong growth potential for the near term, would be a prudent choice.
Bitcoin Rallies Past $90,000
Last week, Bitcoin surpassed $75,000 for the first time, hours after the nation went to polls to elect the 47th President. The cryptocurrency has not looked back since then. Bitcoin had earlier hit an all-time high of $73,770 in March but suffered over the next three months.
However, it staged a rebound in mid-September after the Federal Reserve announced a 50-basis point interest rate cut, ending its monetary tightening campaign in its bid to curb the 40-year-high inflation.
The rally was further fueled last week following Trump’s victory in the election that saw Bitcoin hitting a fresh high. Earlier this week, Bitcoin surpassed $80,000 for the first time and on Tuesday, it hit a new milestone of $90,000, gaining 34% since Trump’s win. The cryptocurrency was last trading at $87250 and is on track to surpass $100,000 in the near term.
Trump promised during his campaign to make the United States a leader in the digital asset sector, which would involve building a strategic Bitcoin reserve and selecting regulators who are enthusiastic about digital assets. The positive sentiment is now boosting Bitcoin. Also, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last week, its second straight interest rate cut in three months, which bodes well for the crypto market.

20241113,NVDA,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed likely to keep alive a class-action lawsuit accusing Nvidia (NVDA) of misleading investors about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency.
The justices heard arguments in the tech company's appeal of a lower-court ruling allowing a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm to continue.
It’s one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. Last week, the justices wrestled with whether to shut down a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit against Facebook parent Meta stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.

On Wednesday, a majority of the court that included liberal and conservative justices appeared to reject the arguments advanced by Neal Katyal, the lawyer for Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia.
“It’s less and less clear why we took this case and why you should win it,” Justice Elena Kagan said.
The lawsuit followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia's revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company's stock price.
In 2022, Nvidia paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.
That chipmaking dominance has cemented Nvidia’s place as the poster child of the artificial intelligence boom — what CEO Jensen Huang has dubbed “the next industrial revolution.” Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia’s specialized chips over the last year.
Nvidia is among the most valuable companies in the S&P 500, worth over $3 trillion. The company is set to report its third quarter earnings next week.
In the Supreme Court case, the company is arguing that the investors' lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints.
A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration is backing the investors.

Trending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date.
Dave Brown, AWS’s VP of compute and networking services, highlighted the significance of offering an alternative to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI processor market.
""We want to be absolutely the best place to run Nvidia,"" he said. ""But at the same time we think it's healthy to have an alternative.""
Amazon’s capital spending is expected to reach $75 billion in 2024, with a large portion dedicated to tech infrastructure, up from $48.4 billion in 2023, reflecting the AI investment trend among major cloud providers.

Why It Matters: Amazon’s move to launch new AI chips is part of a broader strategy to strengthen its position in the AI market. The company is reportedly considering a second multi-billion-dollar investment in AI startup Anthropic, which utilizes Amazon’s cloud services for training. This follows an initial $4 billion investment last year, with Amazon encouraging Anthropic to use its chips.
In October, Amazon signed a five-year deal with Databricks to provide cost-effective AI-building capabilities, positioning its Trainium AI chips as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs.

The meteoric rise of tech stocks like Nvidia has made many investors incredibly rich. They are examples of companies whose values have skyrocketed because they make products that support AI, but if you missed out on them, this sector is full of other potential big winners. One is Penguin Solutions, which is coming off a disappointing Q3 2024. So, why are so many analysts bullish on it?

One of the most pressing questions facing the tech industry is how to expand and maximize AI’s capabilities. That's why data center REITs and utility stocks are so hot. AI consumes data and power at geometric rates. However, it also depends on memory and storage. Penguin Solutions (Nasdaq: PENG) provides a full range of products and services that help data centers and tech companies satisfy AI's intense memory requirements.
A partial list of Penguin’s products includes solid-state servers, LED applications and build-to-suit solutions for data centers. Penguin was originally formed in 1988 under the name SMART Global Holdings. In the 36 years since it was founded, Penguin has become a trusted service provider for multiple sectors, including:
·      Telecommunications
·      Health care
·      Energy sector
·      Government and education
Trending: During market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses.
Despite that strong client base, Penguin’s stock has been down about 10% this year and the company just released a less-than-stellar Q4 2024 earnings report. The company's earnings per share (EPS) of $0.37 bested the $0.35 of Q3 2023 but fell short of the $0.40 EPS analysts predicted. Net sales of $1.2 billion were also less than 2023's $1.4 billion. This led to a sell-off in late October and Penguin is now trading at $17.29.
That's a relatively low buy-in for a 30-plus-year-old company that provides AI and tech solutions to clients in multiple sectors. Analysts at Goldman agree and recently gave Penguin a ""buy"" rating. Goldman believes that Penguin's roster of products and services, plus its low share price, adds up to an undervalued stock. Their forecast for Penguin stock is $21, but Stifel analysts think Penguin shares can hit $27.

SmartAsset’s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.
There also seems to be a consensus between Penguin's management and its analysts regarding a revenue rebound in 2025. Penguin management predicts revenue will increase by 15% and analysts expect revenue to match the $1.4 billion of 2023. If Penguin hits those targets, the share price is set for a strong increase. If shares reach the halfway point between the $21 and $27 analysts predict, Penguin investors will have a happy 2025.
That would see Penguin shares trading around $24, a near 35% gain on the current $17.29 share price. It's important to remember that there is no guarantee that Penguin will hit the targets set by analysts. However, it's also possible that Penguin will exceed those expectations and become a big winner in 2025. So, if you're looking for an affordable tech stock and missed out on Nvidia, give Penguin a look.

A lot has been made of the recent efforts by the United States government to tighten chip exports to China. This coordinated effort, just before Donald Trump takes office, includes stricter license restrictions on US chip firms doing business with China, added scrutiny on those that assemble their hardware in China, and an appeal to allies in Europe and Asia to follow suit. These efforts have only served to further bolster the semiconductor index in China, which leaped to a record high on November 11 amid reports that a recent US order to halt TSM chip supplies to China would accelerate efforts in Beijing to set up advanced chip manufacturing companies in the Asian country.

Chinese brokerage Cinda Securities, in a note published on the China chip situation on November 10, has said that in the medium and long term it will force the reorganization of the supply chain, increase the demand for domestic advanced process production capacity, and promote technological breakthroughs in upstream semiconductor equipment and materials. Many Chinese firms are reliant on TSM chips - 11% of TSM revenue is linked to China - and analysts expect these firms to undergo short-term pain from the US measures, but back them to emerge stronger in the long term due to improvement of domestic chip manufacturing.

Market Capitalization: $3.6 Trillion
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 11, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar raised the price target on Nvidia to $175 from $140 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The advisory also elevated Nvidia to its top large-cap pick given the company's dominant positioning in artificial intelligence accelerators and the upcoming launch of the Blackwell architecture. The total addressable market for AI accelerators will continue to rise in 2025 by $70 billion, and Nvidia is well positioned to capture most of the incremental market increase while ceding only a small bit to its merchant chip competitors, Kumar told investors in a research note. On Nvidia's Q3 report, Piper's bull case projected a beat of roughly $1.3 billion in revenue for the October quarter and a beat of around $1.5 billion in a greatly supply-constrained January quarter.

20241113,NVDA,"Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 20, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +85%.
Revenues are expected to be $32.81 billion, up 81.1% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.57% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Story Continues
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?
For Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.30%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.
So, this combination indicates that Nvidia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.68, delivering a surprise of +6.25%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Nvidia appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

20241113,MSFT,"The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.
The president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act — and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech’s future.
Trump hasn’t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He’s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election — and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn’t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.
But Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.
Now, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump’s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech’s major players.
Antitrust regulation
The Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech’s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.

But a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business “more fair.”
It doesn’t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect’s stop at a McDonald’s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.
Story Continues
“The fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,” explained director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.
AI legislation
Generative AI didn’t take the world by storm until well after Trump’s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.
FILE - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS
Regulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there’s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.
The Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump’s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden’s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.
However, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.
“We've seen when that happens,” explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. “When that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.”
Trump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn’t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.
The CHIPS Act and tariffs
The second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.
But Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.

While it’s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.
“The CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,” Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.
But during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.
Tariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.
“Hardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,” explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.
“So whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.”
That could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.

20241113,MSFT,"Microsoft's (MSFT, Financials) gaming chief Phil Spencer is actively exploring acquisitions to expand Xbox's presence in handheld gaming and mobile game stores, Bloomberg News reports.
Spencer pointed out that any negotiations might center on improving geographical variety, especially in Asia.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.
Adding more mobile startups would complement the portfolio Microsoft acquired last year from its $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, Spencer said. Nonetheless, he pointed out that Microsoft is now more focused on integrating Activision's personnel, hence significant acquisitions are unlikely in the foreseeable future.
""We definitely want to be in the market, and when we can find teams and technology and capability that add to what we're trying to do in gaming at Microsoft, absolutely we will keep our heads up,"" Spencer said. He noted that there is nothing ""imminent.""
Spencer also highlighted intentions to expand Xbox's game development teams, stressing China. Through a partnership with Tencent (TCEHY, Financials), Microsoft recently debuted a new mobile edition of their venerable game, Age of Empires. The real opportunity is to partner with creative teams in China for global reach, Spencer said.
Microsoft's gaming business wants to maximize the functionality of the Xbox software on current handheld devices and work with hardware makers to guarantee Xbox game compatibility in the near future.
About the intended mobile game web store, Spencer mentioned that debut has been postponed for more market research. Xbox President Sarah Bond first revealed the store in May, then anticipated it to open in July. In this regard, Apple's (AAPL, Financials) App Store and Alphabet's (GOOGL, Financials) Google Play remain leaders, so posing a challenge for Microsoft.
Spencer, seeing expansion in cloud, PC, and console gaming, is hopeful about Xbox's future. Pointing to a good trend for 2025, he said, ""The Xbox business has never been more healthy.""

The GitHub ecosystem continues to show impressive momentum, with Copilot Enterprise customers increasing 55% quarter over quarter. The launch of GitHub Copilot Workspace and Autofix features, which help developers fix vulnerabilities three times faster, demonstrates Microsoft's commitment to innovation in the developer tools market. The introduction of GitHub Spark further expands the platform's reach by enabling natural language app development.
Healthcare and Industry-Specific Solutions Drive Growth
Microsoft's vertical integration strategy is showing particular success in healthcare, where DAX Copilot now processes over 1.3 million physician-patient encounters monthly across more than 500 healthcare organizations. The service's revenue growth is outpacing GitHub Copilot's first-year performance, suggesting strong potential in industry-specific applications.
Security and Infrastructure Investment
The company's commitment to security remains paramount, with the Secure Future Initiative engaging 34,000 full-time equivalent engineers. This substantial investment, while necessary, impacts near-term profitability. Microsoft's Defender has helped secure over 750,000 GenAI app instances, while Purview has audited more than a billion Copilot interactions.

Business Applications and LinkedIn Show Strong Momentum
Dynamics 365 continues to gain market share, with monthly active users of Copilot across CRM and ERP solutions increasing more than 60% quarter over quarter. LinkedIn's performance remains strong, with double-digit growth in key markets like India and Brazil, and a 6x quarter-over-quarter increase in weekly immersive video views.
Enterprise Integration Shows Promise
Enterprise customers are showing strong confidence in Copilot's capabilities, as evidenced by major deployments like Vodafone's 68,000-employee rollout and UBS' 50,000-seat implementation — the largest in the financial services sector to date. Notable efficiency gains, such as Vodafone's reported three hours saved per employee per week, demonstrate tangible business value that could drive further adoption.
Developer Tools and Platform Growth
GitHub Copilot's momentum continues with a 55% quarter-over-quarter increase in Enterprise customers. The introduction of GitHub Copilot Workspace and Autofix features, along with the new GitHub Spark platform, positions Microsoft strongly in the developer tools market. The company reports that Copilot Autofix helps developers fix vulnerabilities three times faster than traditional methods.
Healthcare and Industry-Specific Applications Show Promise
DAX Copilot's rapid adoption in healthcare, now processing more than 1.3 million physician-patient encounters monthly across 500+ organizations, demonstrates Microsoft's successful vertical integration strategy. The service is reportedly growing faster than GitHub Copilot did in its first year, suggesting potential for sustained growth in industry-specific applications.
Investment Perspective: Patience May Be Rewarded
While Microsoft's AI initiatives demonstrate impressive growth and adoption metrics, several factors suggest investors might benefit from waiting for better entry points. Management expects H2 revenue growth to remain relatively stable compared with the second quarter, with M365 Copilot seat revenues projected to grow gradually over time. The significant allocation of resources to security and infrastructure development may impact near-term margins.

The AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with tech giants like Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, Nvidia NVDA and Oracle ORCL making significant investments and advancements in the field. Microsoft's success will hinge on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and effectively monetize its AI technologies. Additionally, looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to the AI-driven growth prospects of the industry.

With a 12.5% year-to-date gain, Microsoft has underperformed both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500 index’s return of 29.5% and 26.3%, respectively. This raises a crucial question of whether MSFT's AI advancements will provide the needed boost to its stock performance.
Year-to-date Performance
Zacks Investment Research

Current stock prices may already reflect much of the near-term growth potential from AI initiatives. Microsoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.78X exceeding both the Zacks Computer - Software industry average of 7.93X and its own historical median of 10.15X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about potential limitations and whether the company's performance can justify this premium in the long term.

As Microsoft navigates these challenges, investors will be closely watching its ability to translate AI innovations into tangible financial results and market outperformance.

Conclusion
For current shareholders, the strong adoption metrics and enterprise customer wins suggest holding positions could be rewarding over the long term. However, new investors might benefit from waiting for more attractive entry points, particularly given the general market volatility and the possibility of short-term fluctuations as the company continues to invest heavily in AI infrastructure and security measures.

A lot has been made of the recent efforts by the United States government to tighten chip exports to China. This coordinated effort, just before Donald Trump takes office, includes stricter license restrictions on US chip firms doing business with China, added scrutiny on those that assemble their hardware in China, and an appeal to allies in Europe and Asia to follow suit. These efforts have only served to further bolster the semiconductor index in China, which leaped to a record high on November 11 amid reports that a recent US order to halt TSM chip supplies to China would accelerate efforts in Beijing to set up advanced chip manufacturing companies in the Asian country.

Chinese brokerage Cinda Securities, in a note published on the China chip situation on November 10, has said that in the medium and long term it will force the reorganization of the supply chain, increase the demand for domestic advanced process production capacity, and promote technological breakthroughs in upstream semiconductor equipment and materials. Many Chinese firms are reliant on TSM chips - 11% of TSM revenue is linked to China - and analysts expect these firms to undergo short-term pain from the US measures, but back them to emerge stronger in the long term due to improvement of domestic chip manufacturing.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Microsoft's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions
The top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company
Insiders have sold recently
Every investor in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Microsoft, beginning with the chart below.
View our latest analysis for Microsoft
ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Microsoft?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Microsoft already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Microsoft's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Microsoft. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. With 7.5% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
Insider Ownership Of Microsoft
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Story Continues
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Microsoft Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.0b of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.
General Public Ownership
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Microsoft. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Next Steps:
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Microsoft , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

20241113,MSFT,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Virtual Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best virtual reality stocks.
Overview of the Global VR Market
Virtual Reality is a computer-generated simulation that allows users to interact with a three-dimensional environment. The four elements that characterize virtual reality and differentiate it from other technologies such as augmented reality and mixed reality are a 3D-simulated environment, immersion, sensory engagement, and realistic interactivity, as revealed by HP.
According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global virtual reality market size was valued at $25.11 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow from $32.64 billion in 2024 to $244.84 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 28.6% during the forecast period (2024-2032).
Region-wise, North America is expected to dominate the global VR market over the forecast period. Another rapidly growing region is Asia Pacific with growth driven by the rising demand for immersive technologies in emerging economies. China, one of the major distributors of head-mounted VR devices and other hardware, is forecasted to have the highest market share in the region. Simultaneously, Europe is the early adopter of virtual solutions in the automotive industry and will be experiencing significant growth, with Germany and the UK as its leading markets.
How is Virtual Reality Transforming Today's World?
The virtual reality devices used today have their foundation laid on the first head-mounted augmented reality display ""The Sword of Damocles"" which was introduced by Ivan Sutherland in 1968. While firms such as Sega and Nintendo developed VR gaming systems in the 1980s and 1990s, it was not until the 2010s that high-quality VR headsets boasting powerful graphics and motion-tracking technology came to the market.
While gaming has been driving the popularity of VR, the potential of the technology has been realized in a multitude of other industries. The American shipping company UPS committed to millions for the advanced training of its drivers, with the firm’s industry-leading training powered by the use of virtual reality in an industrial training environment. Before drivers operate an actual delivery vehicle, the company's Driving Simulator provides realistic driving experiences.
Virtual reality and augmented reality have also penetrated the healthcare sector as they offer transformative opportunities for medical training, patient care, and therapeutic interventions. The treatment domains in which these technologies are used to treat patients are diverse and include pediatric diagnostics and treatments, pain management, mental health, neurological disorders, surgery planning, intraoperative procedures, telemedicine, as well as post-operative and other rehabilitation therapies. The penetration is evident from the fact that the US FDA has authorized 69 medical devices that incorporate augmented reality and virtual reality.
Story Continues
Virtual Reality is also changing the game for the entertainment industry, especially for artists. Fortnite witnessed a record turnout of more than 12 million attendees to its virtual concert featuring the hip-hop superstar Travis Scott in 2020. Therefore, VR applications continue to spread around today’s world. The renowned luxury car manufacturer BMW has materialized virtual reality experiences in the automotive space. The company expanded its revolutionary driving experience with BMW M Mixed Reality which tends to blur the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds through state-of-the-art VR/MR technologies.

20241113,MSFT,"(Bloomberg) -- After a tough year, Microsoft Corp.’s video-gaming chief is still looking at acquisitions and charting how to compete and partner in the markets for handheld game devices and mobile stores.

Deals that add “geographic diversity,” including in Asia, might be worthwhile, Phil Spencer said in an interview Tuesday at Bloomberg’s offices in New York. Buying another mobile company would add to titles Microsoft picked up in its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year, he said.
“We definitely want to be in the market, and when we can find teams and technology and capability that add to what we’re trying to do in gaming at Microsoft, absolutely we will keep our heads up,” Spencer said. Still, there’s nothing “imminent” and very large deals are probably off the table at present as the company is spending a lot of time absorbing Activision Blizzard employees, he said.
Microsoft wants to diversify the teams working on games by looking more to China, he said. The company developed a new mobile version of Age of Empires, a world-building franchise that first appeared in the 1990s, by partnering with Tencent Holdings Ltd. Microsoft and Tencent released the game globally in October.
“It’s been a good area for us to learn from creative teams that have real unique capability,” Spencer said. “The real opportunity is to partner with creative teams in China for global.”
The executive, who has repeatedly professed his admiration for handheld game devices, said the “expectation is that we would do something” in that category. Although the company is working on prototypes and considering what it might do, Spencer also asked his group to look at the market and develop its vision based on what it learns. Such a device is a few years out, he said.
In the coming months, designers and engineers will focus on making the Xbox app work better on existing portable devices and partnering with hardware makers to make sure their products sync with Xbox games and experiences, he said. The Xbox app right now is good rather than great on some of these gadgets, he said.
“Longer term, I love us building devices,” Spencer said. “And I think our team could do some real innovative work, but we want to be informed by learning and what’s happening now.”
Story Continues
The company’s planned online store for mobile games has been delayed as the group does additional research on the market, Spencer said. Xbox President Sarah Bond had announced the store in May, with a planned release date of July. But staffers are still talking to mobile developers, including those responsible for Microsoft-owned Candy Crush and Call of Duty Mobile, to figure out a plan. As regulatory cases involving Apple Inc.’s iOS and Alphabet Inc.’s Android mobile stores work their way through courts in various countries, Microsoft still doesn’t have an effective way to get its own store on mobile phones.
“So a web store would mean somebody doesn't have to go into the app store to try to install something, but you still have to have a way to find the store,” Spencer said. “If we’re just hoping, like, if we build it, they will come, I’m going to bet that doesn’t work.”
That means Xbox has to make its store unique for players and figure out what will draw content creators. At the same time, it’s preparing for a world where Apple and Google mobile devices are more open to Xbox.
“I think the ball is moving in the right direction,” Spencer said. “I think this idea of open platforms, where users have more choice, creators have more choice, you see the momentum, right?”
After releasing the first batch of Xbox games for Sony Group Corp.’s PlayStation and Nintendo Co.’s Switch, Spencer is pleased with the results. Microsoft will do more of that, he said, and won’t rule out any game in Microsoft’s stable.
“I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’ ” he said. It’s too early to make any sort of decision on the next version of Halo, he said.
Following the Activision acquisition, Xbox cut more than 2,500 jobs and closed three game-design studios. With the company exiting what management calls a difficult year amid a challenging mobile-game market, Spencer feels good about 2025.
“The Xbox business has never been more healthy,” he said, citing growth in cloud and PC gaming as well as console usage. “The business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build.”
Spencer also said he’s optimistic about the growth of mobile games.
“I feel pretty good about where this industry is going,’’ he said. “To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We’re not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles.”

20241113,MSFT,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. and Royal Bank of Canada have agreed to buy carbon dioxide removal credits from Canada’s first commercial facility to suck carbon from the air.

Pulling carbon from the atmosphere is increasingly important in limiting global warming to relatively safe levels. The world will likely need to take billions of tons of CO2 from the air per year by mid-century, yet current capacity is just a fraction of that. A wave of startups is attempting to address that using a range of techniques, including deploying machines that perform what’s known as direct air capture (DAC).
“We need to prove that this stuff works. We need to prove that we can actually build the projects we say we're going to build, and we actually have to deliver credits to the customers who have, over the last couple of years, been making commitments to future supply,” said Damien Steel, chief executive officer of Deep Sky. “If that supply doesn't start showing up soon, we as a market are in big trouble.”
Microsoft and RBC agreed to purchase 10,000 tons of CO2 removal services over a 10-year period from Deep Sky, a Canadian project developer with a distinct approach to carbon removal: the company is convening multiple technologies at the same site, powered by a single energy source and funneling CO2 to the same storage well. Deep Sky is building a facility in Alberta that, upon completion, is expected to house eight DAC units, each designed and built by a different startup.
Co-founder Fred Lalonde, who is also the co-founder and chief executive officer of Canadian travel company and unicorn startup Hopper Inc., said he wasn’t going to “sit here and watch the world burn.”
Centralizing different startups’ DAC units in a single location will help reduce overhead and increase the pace of innovation, said Lalonde. It’s also expected to help free them from the headache of permitting for CO2 storage and purchasing clean energy to power the machines pulling carbon from the air — a task becoming increasingly hard amid the AI data center boom.
“They can go through innovation cycles on a rapid basis across a very large, diverse technology set to push down costs, timeline to deployment and overall scale potential,” said Brian Marrs, Microsoft’s senior director of energy and carbon removal, who called Deep Sky a “playground for direct air capture.”
Story Continues
Dedicated corporate buyers with hard-to-reach net zero goals and deep pockets have poured millions into helping these startups grow, with Microsoft a particular leader. The tech giant has targeted being carbon-negative by 2030 yet its emissions have risen more than 40% since 2020, driven in part by an AI push that has put its climate targets at risk.
Deep Sky expects its Alberta facility to be operational by the end of March and to be delivering credits to customers by June. With a 3,000-ton-per-year capacity, it’s small but will prove to buyers and investors that the technology works, according to vice president of carbon markets Charlie Renzoni. Deep Sky is also working on building three much larger commercial sites throughout Canada, all of which have initial allocations of renewable power from their local utilities.
Carbon removal is a growing part of corporate decarbonization strategies, particularly for companies seeking higher-quality carbon credits amid a flawed market. Yet the Deep Sky deal is a tiny fraction of Microsoft’s overall carbon removal portfolio, which includes millions of tons purchased from projects including bioenergy and carbon capture from Stockholm Exergi and Orsted A/S and direct air capture from 1PointFive and Heirloom Carbon Technologies. This marks RBC’s first DAC purchase.
Steel thinks that within the next 15 years, pressure for corporations and governments to cut emissions will become impossible to ignore. “What we're trying to do at Deep Sky is invest and get ourselves as far along the innovation curve as possible so that when we inevitably reach a point where we don't have a choice,” he said. “We actually have a solution that can scale.”

CrowdStrike’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company’s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.
The company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm’s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.
This robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike’s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company’s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.
CrowdStrike’s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation
CrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.
The Falcon platform’s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike’s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.

CrowdStrike’s Market Position and Customer Loyalty
CrowdStrike’s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm’s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.
Moreover, the company's “Falcon Flex” subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.
Navigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike
Despite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company’s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management’s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.
Analysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.

Potential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike’s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.
CrowdStrike’s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern
CrowdStrike’s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry’s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.

Conclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now
While CrowdStrike’s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.
CrowdStrike’s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241113,CRWD,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Performing Cybersecurity Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.
Data Breaches to Disruptions
The technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025—a 300% increase from 2015 levels.
A Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.
AI Meets Cybercrime
As AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.
AI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. “Cyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,” noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.
Nonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 “will be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,” yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI’s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively—closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.

The constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.

Our Methodology
To compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)
Year-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.
Earlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike’s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn’t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.
CrowdStrike’s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon’s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.
ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.”
Overall, CRWD ranks 6th on our list of  best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241113,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
CrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
CrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Is Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?
On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.
Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.
McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.
McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.”
On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.
Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.
He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.
Story Continues
As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.

20241113,CRWD,"For many, the main point of investing in the stock market is to achieve spectacular returns. While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. For example, the CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) share price is up a whopping 452% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. It's also good to see the share price up 37% over the last quarter.
Since it's been a strong week for CrowdStrike Holdings shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.
View our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings
Given that CrowdStrike Holdings only made minimal earnings in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue to gauge its business development. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.
In the last 5 years CrowdStrike Holdings saw its revenue grow at 39% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Fortunately, the market has not missed this, and has pushed the share price up by 41% per year in that time. Despite the strong run, top performers like CrowdStrike Holdings have been known to go on winning for decades. On the face of it, this looks lke a good opportunity, although we note sentiment seems very positive already.

Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on stocks that could perform well regardless of who ends up running the White House. On Tuesday, Cramer observed that the day’s market performance gave the impression that every stock could go higher no matter who secures the presidency.
He pointed to significant gains across various sectors, including aerospace, housing, retail, and healthcare. Cramer noted that this broad-based rally resulted in strong performances on Tuesday, with the Dow climbing 427 points, the S&P rising by 1.23%, and the NASDAQ soaring by 1.43%. However, he tempered his optimism by adding that days like Tuesday might prove to be outliers in the coming weeks.

Cramer took the opportunity to highlight ten stocks he believes will thrive and said:
“I want to highlight ten stocks that I believe will do well under either candidate, a who’s who of acclamation, companies that almost have to do well because of seismic trends and savvy managements. Companies that no White House would get hung up on, either because they’re beneath notice or they’re perceived as good corporate citizens by both sides. Stocks in industries that neither Trump nor Harris have ever targeted in the past.”
He also raised an important question for the viewers: “If you had the results of the election in hand, would you really know what to buy or sell?” According to Cramer, answering that question is far more complicated than it seems. He emphasized his list of stocks that can thrive regardless of the election outcome. These are companies that have no clear political adversaries in Washington, making them relatively safe bets. Cramer acknowledged, however, that many stocks that seem like obvious picks for one candidate or another often have hidden dynamics that don’t get enough attention.
“In the end, this presidential prognostication game is meaningless until we start hearing about cabinet appointments, those will tell us a lot. Then, we can figure out really who the winners and losers are. Right now, though, there are just too many political angles to every single stock story.”
Our Methodology
For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 5. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.

Cramer said that he is a  big believer of cybersecurity, which is why his trust owns CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock.
“Hey, speaking of hating to lose the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, that's Desh Aurora, and the CEO of CrowdStrike, that's George Kurtz, are both extremely competitive. They know how to stop cybercrime better than anyone. I know it hurts our diversification efforts, but the Charitable Trust owns both these stocks because I'm a huge believer in cybersecurity and I'm not gonna be left behind by a great stock here. There's so much crime happening online. These companies literally can't handle all the business. Imagine that, I call that a high-quality problem.”
CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) offers cybersecurity solutions. It is known for its Falcon platform, a comprehensive suite of endpoint security solutions. Despite facing challenges earlier this year due to an outage that temporarily impacted its reputation, the company continues to be regarded as a top player in its field. During the fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings call, which ended on July 31, CEO George Kurtz acknowledged that the outage caused some prospective customers to delay signing contracts.
However, he emphasized that most of these deals remain active in the sales pipeline, indicating that the company’s position in the market is still strong. Its Falcon platform offers a wide range of security tools, with 28 modules available to customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, 65% of its customers were using at least five of these modules. The number of deals involving eight or more modules saw a significant increase, up 66% compared to the same period last year.
CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) uses generative AI to detect threats and respond to potential breaches more rapidly. The company claims to have ""the industry's most complete AI-native defense,"" positioning its technology as highly advanced. Its AI models are trained on data from more than 2 trillion incidents every day, enabling them to continually improve in terms of both speed and accuracy. This sophisticated approach to threat detection is central to the company’s value proposition and has helped maintain its reputation as a leader in endpoint security.
Overall CRWD ranks 5th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks that can do well regardless of who wins. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241113,CRWD,"We recently published a list of 12 AI News and Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news.
CNBC’s Deidre Bosa joined ‘Money Movers’ to discuss the potential impact of a second Trump administration on the artificial intelligence trade. Bosa notes that artificial intelligence could be “less regulated” and “more volatile” under Trump's leadership. However, the president-elect’s AI policy could be a boon to the industry itself, albeit at the expense of necessary guardrails for AI. Back in June, Republicans adopted a new party platform containing a provision related to scrapping Biden’s executive orders on AI.
READ ALSO: 10 AI News You Shouldn’t Miss and 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News
Biden’s executive orders sought to tackle new technology threats by requiring developers of powerful AI systems to share their safety test results with the US government and also called on federal agencies to develop guidelines for the responsible use of AI domains. On the other hand, Trump’s allies have been proposing a different executive order that would launch a series of “Manhattan Projects” for developing military technology and immediately review “unnecessary and burdensome regulations” to “Make America Great in AI”.
Trump, however, seems to be only one of the few who thinks imposing guardrails on artificial intelligence could prove detrimental to the US. A poll shared with Time reveals that Americans across the political spectrum are skeptical about the idea that the U.S. should avoid regulating AI to outcompete China. According to a poll by the AI Policy Institute (AIPI), 75% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans believe that “taking a careful controlled approach” to AI is preferable as opposed to “moving forward on AI as fast as possible to be the first country to get extremely powerful AI.”
The Latest Developments in AI
Amid the ongoing debate, recent developments in AI are rapidly shaping the landscape in the backdrop. For instance, Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine, is said to be raising new investment that would value the search startup to a staggering $9 billion. The new funding round is set to raise $500 million led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which also holds a board seat in the startup.
In other news, OpenAI, an AI research lab and company, has acquired Chat.com, further adding to its collection of high-profile domain names. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the acquisition via email. While such AI-related news is often striking, AI capabilities continue to surprise even the most seasoned experts. In fact, AI can now even help you become a better parent. On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz's partner Justine Moore took to X to share an investment idea, advocating for ""a new wave of 'parenting co-pilots' powered by LLMs and agents. She highlighted companies such as Cradlewise, creators of an AI-driven baby monitor that tracks sleep patterns and rocks the crib, and Nanit, which utilizes AI to analyze crib footage and monitor a baby's breathing.

AUSTIN, Texas & AMSTERDAM, November 06, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fal.Con Europe -- CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) today announced it has agreed to acquire Adaptive Shield, a leader in SaaS Security. With this acquisition, CrowdStrike will be the only cybersecurity vendor to provide unified, end-to-end protection against identity-based attacks across the entire modern cloud ecosystem – from on-premises Active Directory to cloud-based identity providers and SaaS applications – delivered from a single, unified platform. Announced at Fal.Con Europe, CrowdStrike’s inaugural premier user conference in the region, this acquisition will position CrowdStrike as the leading provider of comprehensive protection across complex hybrid environments.
""CrowdStrike was built to tackle the toughest cybersecurity challenges, and we drive relentless innovation based on what our customers need to stay ahead of modern threats,"" said George Kurtz, CEO and founder, CrowdStrike.

With the acquisition of Adaptive Shield, CrowdStrike will continue to set the standard for identity-based protection in the cloud, delivering best-in-class SaaS protection from the Falcon platform.""
Identity-Based Attacks in the Cloud Target SaaS Applications
Cloud exploitation cases grew by 110% last year, while identity-based attacks continue to rise – 75% of attacks to gain initial access are now malware-free. ‘Cross-domain’ adversaries, targeting identity and cloud, have numerous attack paths, from on-premises Active Directory to cloud-based identity providers and the growing landscape of SaaS applications. The complexity of modern hybrid cloud environments and disconnected security tools create protection gaps, making it difficult to prevent identity-based threats. SaaS is projected to be the largest category of cloud computing in 2024, capturing more than 40% of all public cloud spending1. Under the SaaS shared responsibility model, SaaS vendors provide security controls, while organizations manage configurations. In today’s complex environments, where hundreds of SaaS applications each come with unique access controls and identity configurations, security teams face significant challenges in maintaining visibility into who has access, what sensitive data is exposed, and active threats – even with purpose-built SaaS protection.

Adaptive Shield and the Falcon Platform – Comprehensive Identity and SaaS Security
Adaptive Shield delivers the industry’s most complete security posture management and threat protection across SaaS identities, misconfigurations and data, stopping SaaS breaches. As an integrated component of the CrowdStrike Falcon® cybersecurity platform, Adaptive Shield will equip CrowdStrike with the most advanced capabilities to stop identity-based attacks across all aspects of modern hybrid cloud environments. Customer benefits will include:
Comprehensive SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM): Organizations gain full visibility and governance over misconfigurations, the entitlements and activity levels of both human and non-human identities, and exposed data across 150+ SaaS applications. This new end-to-end visibility of identities across hybrid cloud environments gives operators unique context for rapid cloud detection and response (CDR).
GenAI Application Security Control: By continuously monitoring GenAI SaaS applications, Adaptive Shield empowers organizations to enforce consistent security standards by detecting configuration shifts, controlling AI settings to prevent data leakage, and identifying shadow AI applications to revoke access based on their risk profile. This approach ensures that AI-integrated applications remain aligned with security policies to protect sensitive data.
Unified Hybrid Identity and Cloud Security: The powerful combination of Adaptive Shield and CrowdStrike Falcon® Identity Protection will provide customers with comprehensive identity protection across SaaS, on-premises Active Directory and cloud-based environments (Okta and Microsoft Entra ID). CrowdStrike Falcon® Cloud Security customers will also gain unified visibility and protection across the entire modern cloud estate – infrastructure, custom applications, data, AI models and SaaS applications – all from the same unified console and workflow.
Existing Integration Accelerates Detection and Response: Adaptive Shield’s existing integration with CrowdStrike Falcon® Next-Gen SIEM provides rapid first-party detection and response across multiple security domains – endpoints, identities, workloads and applications – automatically correlating detections inline with the latest threat intelligence and Falcon Fusion SOAR delivering near real-time response.
""Widespread adoption of SaaS applications has rapidly expanded the enterprise attack surface, as shared responsibility models and fragmented security controls make SaaS environments a prime target,"" said Maor Bin, CEO and co-founder, Adaptive Shield. ""Our mission perfectly complements CrowdStrike, stopping SaaS breaches while further accelerating consolidation on cybersecurity's most comprehensive platform. I'm incredibly proud of our team for building the most advanced SaaS security solution, defining the market.""

Conclusion
The Growth Score of C reflects apprehensions over AVGO’s prospects, which, along with stretched valuation, makes Broadcom a risky bet.

However, Broadcom’s strong portfolio, along with an expanding partner base, surely reflects solid top-line growth potential. We believe these factors justify the premium valuation.

20241113,AVGO,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks that should not be ignored.
Artificial Intelligence is driving an unprecedented expansion in the potential market size for hardware and software products. According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the “CNBC Connect” event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI’s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology.
“Three years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you”.

Latest Developments in AI
Let’s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported.
In other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation’s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC’s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation.

Speaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training—the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures—have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring “test-time compute,” a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called “inference” phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia’s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

20241113,AVGO,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Performing Cybersecurity Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.
Data Breaches to Disruptions
The technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025—a 300% increase from 2015 levels.
A Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.
AI Meets Cybercrime
As AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.
AI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. “Cyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,” noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.
Nonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 “will be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,” yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI’s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively—closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.
Story Continues
The constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.

Our Methodology
To compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Year-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 69.19%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 130
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology powerhouse known for its expertise in semiconductor design, development, and supply, alongside its enterprise software and security solutions. The company’s cybersecurity portfolio includes a range of products, such as its Symantec Enterprise Cloud platform, as well as solutions for payment, mainframe, network, endpoint, and identity security.
In the third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, marking a 47% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and solid non-AI semiconductor performance. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects its AI revenue to rise 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the total for the year to $12 billion, primarily fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.
On November 5, BofA reaffirmed its Buy rating on AVGO, citing the company's leadership in AI computing and networking, along with its strong free cash flow. However, the bank lowered its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast due to seasonal challenges, particularly stemming from a product transition with Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) that is expected to affect revenue in the first half of the year. Still, Broadcom’s position is expected to be buoyed by new AI and networking contracts, along with further opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to adjusted earnings per share of $7.31 by 2026. As AI adoption continues to grow, Broadcom’s focus on high-performance AI networking solutions, especially in complement to NVIDIA’s Blackwell architecture, could potentially strengthen its future prospects.
Overall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of  best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
Analyst Blayne Curtis highlighted that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are strategically positioned to capitalize on the AI chip market surge. Curtis has assigned Buy ratings to each of these companies.
Jensen Huang-led Nvidia is experiencing extraordinary demand that surpasses its rapidly growing capacity, Curtis noted. Major tech firms are increasing their investments in GPUs and internal ASIC programs, he added. Despite this, Nvidia is expected to maintain its dominant market share, with room for ASICs to expand, Barron’s reported on Tuesday.

Curtis projects the AI accelerator market to expand by 58% annually, growing from $47 billion in 2023 to $287 billion by 2027. He sees no slowdown in capital expenditure from tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta.
Marvell and Nvidia are expected to see the most immediate gains, with Broadcom likely to outperform later in 2025. Currently, Broadcom’s AI chip business is largely driven by Google by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), but Curtis anticipates broader adoption in the coming years. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also disclosed in late June the purchase of 20 call options in Broadcom.

20241113,AVGO,"We recently published a list of UBS’ Top Quant Stocks In AI, IT, Healthcare & Other Sectors: Top 33 Stocks In All Sectors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other UBS’ top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors.
With the third quarter of the 2024 earnings season underway, Wall Street is dealing with a changing stock market environment. The Federal Reserve has started its interest rate reduction cycle and market watchers are on the lookout for labor market and inflationary indicators to determine whether the Fed will be able to meet its goal of reducing interest rates by an additional 50 basis points by the end of this year.
Simultaneously, the shifting economic climate is also creating changes in the investment environment. High interest rates traditionally do not mean well for certain stock market sectors barring exceptional circumstances. Some sectors that don’t perform well in a high-rate environment include real estate, healthcare, and technology.
For two of these, this has been the case in the 2022 – 2024 Federal Reserve interest rate hiking cycle as well. Starting from real estate, the flagship S&P index’s real estate sector’s annualized three-year return is currently -2.66%. From its peak of 324.75 in December 2021, the index has lost 48.2 points or 14.8%. Similarly, the high-end healthcare and biotechnology sector does not fare well during high interest rates either. Since 2021’s close, the S&P’s pharmaceutical stock index is down by -0.84% while the S&P’s biotechnology index has lost a sizable 12.61%.
This brings us to our third stock market sector, a.k.a, technology. Technology, as you’re likely aware, has seen a lot of investor interest due to the surge in artificial intelligence. Looking at the performance of the S&P’s technology stock index, its performance also mirrors real estate and healthcare stocks before the frenzy around artificial intelligence started. Between 2021’s close and the market’s bottom in October 2022, the index had lost 33%. During the same time period, the real estate, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology stock indexes had lost 34.8%, 12.2%, and 30.5%, respectively. However, market optimism surrounding artificial intelligence has created a clear bifurcation in performance.
As an example, while real estate stocks have gained 29% since the October 2022 bottom and biotechnology stocks have added 25% in value, information technology stocks are up by a whopping 115%. This shows that tech stocks have delivered 4x the returns of both real estate and biotechnology. Driving this is artificial intelligence, with the shares of the world’s premier AI GPU designer up by 690% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.
Story Continues
Looking at these shifts, the next question to ask is which stock market sectors might benefit from the evolving environment moving forward. On this front, investment bank UBS has some insights. In its Equity Compass Report issued in mid-October, the bank identifies key themes and trends for US and global stock markets. Within global and US stock market sectors, the bank has rated only one sector as ‘Most Attractive’. Unsurprisingly, this is the US technology sector which is currently experiencing a sustained surge of investor optimism courtesy of artificial intelligence.
The bank shares several data points to justify its optimism in the US technology sector, and more specifically, artificial intelligence companies. Citing data from the Hugging Face repository, a collection of software development tools, it reveals “an average 200% y/y rise for new AI models and model downloads combined so far in 2024.” UBS is also optimistic about the growing adoption of artificial intelligence in the US business world. AI adoption is key since big technology firms that have invested billions of dollars in AI need it to generate returns on their investment.
As per UBS, data from the Census Bureau’s Business Trends and Outlook (BTOS) survey released in September 2024 shows that AI adoption across the 1.2 million firms tracked was picking up the pace. “In the survey, 5.9% of companies reported using AI as of 3Q24, up from 3.7% in 3Q23,” outlined the bank in its report. Not only did 5.9% of the firms adopt AI, but the survey’s outlook for the next six months revealed that AI adoption across the surveyed population could rise by 2.8 percentage points to sit at 8.7%. Commenting on the implications of the higher adoption, UBS stated that “increasing future adoption will increase visibility on AI monetization, which is consistent with recent comments from leading cloud platforms.” The firms slated to benefit the most from this monetization are those ” with strong footprints in existing customer bases,” believes the bank.
These statements necessitate asking the question of which industries are slated to benefit the most from AI adoption. Fortunately for us, UBS also shares data for the industries currently leading the way with AI adoption and those that could grow adoption in the future. Right now, the information technology and personal services sectors are leading with AI adoption since as of September 2024, their respective adoption percentages were 19.1% and 14.7%. For the next six months, while the same industries are expected to lead the pack in overall AI adoption through their 23% and 19.8% percentages, others are expected to make higher percentage point gains. Two industries that stand out in the report are educational services and the finance and insurance industries.
As per the report, the former is expected to increase its AI adoption by 5.6 percentage points to 18.7% over the next six months from the current value of 13.1%. For the finance and insurance sector, it is expected to mark a 6.2 percentage point jump to 13.4% from the existing AI adoption of 7.2%. Of course, while AI is by far the most popular sector in the market right now, UBS also shares other attractive areas. It outlines that the market “also offers exposure to secular growth in longevity through various US medical device companies. Many US companies are also playing leading roles in the energy transition via electric vehicles, renewables, and energy efficiency.”
Our Methodology
To make our list of UBS stocks with improving quantitative indicators, we chose the firm’s top stocks that are seeing improvements in EPS growth, P/E ratio, and other indicators. Stocks within each sector were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. The sectors themselves were ranked by the cumulative number of funds invested in the firms.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Broadcom Inc (AVGO): AI Growth with Custom Chips and VMWare Boost

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 130
Sector: Information Technology
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. The firm operates in the hardware and software industries. Its key strengths lie on the former front, with Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) responsible for providing networking and custom chips for a wide variety of use cases. These provide the firm with large customers like Apple and have enabled it to establish a foothold in the AI industry. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) benefits from AI through its custom chips, and word on the street is that the firm has partnered up with OpenAI to develop a custom chip. Yet, reliance on customers like Apple is a double-edged sword as it also exposes Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to revenue losses in case its customers decide to develop custom chips. On the software front, the firm’s VMWare acquisition has enabled it to sizably grow its revenue and could lead to further tailwinds in the future.
Baron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:
“Broadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom’s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, “there is only one Broadcom. Period.”
Overall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of UBS’ top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241113,AVGO,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher.
Ken Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory.
Under Fisher’s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times’ list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis
Understanding Bull Markets and the Role of Technology in Investment Strategies
Ken Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm’s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic.
Fisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns.
Ken Fisher Predicts Shift as Value Stocks Begin to Outperform Growth Amid Fed Rate Speculations
Ken Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks.
Story Continues
“As 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn’t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that’s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.”
Additionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources.
As short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 130
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a leader in semiconductor and infrastructure software, delivers high-performance chips and software solutions for the tech and telecom sectors. In Q3 2024, Broadcom outperformed revenue expectations with $13.07 billion, exceeding forecasts by $108.35 million, and achieved a normalized EPS of $1.24, beating estimates by $0.03.
Despite a GAAP EPS loss of $0.40, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s upcoming earnings announcement on December 6, 2024, has analysts projecting strong performance, with a forecasted normalized EPS of $1.39 and revenue reaching $14.09 billion. Over the past 90 days, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has recorded 20 upward EPS revisions, highlighting analyst confidence in its growth trajectory.
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanding market for AI technologies. With rising demand for high-performance computing, Broadcom’s semiconductor products are expected to play a significant role in powering AI applications, driving further revenue growth. Additionally, Broadcom’s strong partnerships with major technology companies strengthen its foundation for sustained success.
Parnassus Value Equity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“During the second quarter, the Fund’s overweight position in the Information Technology sector decreased slightly as we sold our position in Cisco Systems and used most of the proceeds to buy Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a leading semiconductor company and provider of custom silicon products. Both stocks provide similar exposure to networking technology, but we believe Broadcom offers more upside from AI infrastructure spend and defensiveness due to its software assets.
Overall, AVGO ranks 9th on our list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Is Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?
On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.
Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.
McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.
McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.”
On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.
Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.
He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.
Story Continues
As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 130
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.
The company has been performing exceptionally throughout the year, having launched breakthrough technologies that facilitate the management of large datasets for AI tasks and scalable AI systems. Fast forward to November 5th, the company unveiled VeloRAIN, a platform that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the performance of AI security workloads. On the same day, the company’s VMware Cloud Foundation unveiled a private cloud platform to improve customers’ AI autonomy and security.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially to $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion, driven by ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers. Overall, consolidated revenue and net income grew by 47% and 44%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024, driven by growing AI revenue and VMware bookings.
Broadcom Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as it leverages artificial intelligence. In addition to that, company officials believe AVGO is finally achieving stability on a company-wide level and is on track to becoming an AI powerhouse.
ClearBridge Investments’ ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.”
Overall, AVGO ranks 5th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Broadcom's estimated fair value is US$161 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
Broadcom's US$184 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate
The US$194 analyst price target for AVGO is 20% more than our estimate of fair value
How far off is Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.
See our latest analysis for Broadcom
The Calculation
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$293b
Story Continues
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$56b× (1 + 2.6%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.6%) = US$1.0t
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.0t÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$460b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$753b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$184, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
dcf
Important Assumptions
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Broadcom as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.378. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Broadcom, there are three important factors you should assess:

20241113,AVGO,"We recently compiled a list of the 8 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other hot growth stocks.
A month before the election that spelled Donald Trump's victory, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report showing a robust labor market with rising wages, a decrease in unemployment, and the addition of 254,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in September, down from 4.2% in August and 4.3% in July. Earlier concerns arose when the unemployment rate increased, leading some economists to worry that the Federal Reserve’s decision not to cut interest rates impacted the labor market.
However, the Fed eased those concerns in September by cutting the federal funds rate by half a percentage point. The Fed had initially raised rates aggressively beginning in March 2022 to combat inflation, pausing mid-2023. While inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in June 2022, economists note the high rates continue to impact the economy, especially the housing market. That said, Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the housing market on September 30, noting that he expects housing inflation to keep easing and that overall economic conditions are conducive to further disinflation.
On another note, while September's Consumer and Producer Price Indexes aligned with expectations, signaling that inflation is trending toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target, economists at Goldman believe the Fed may have already reached that goal. The investment bank forecasts that the Commerce Department's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for September will show a 12-month inflation rate of 2.04%. If accurate, this figure would be rounded down to 2%, aligning perfectly with the Fed's long-standing objective. This would come just over two years after inflation surged to a 40-year high, prompting a series of aggressive interest rate hikes. Moreover, the S&P 500 has gained 4% since the Fed's rate initial cut last month, as investors have poured over $20 billion into U.S. stock funds.
Both Fundstrat and Goldman raised their year-end stock market forecasts in week 41 of this year, with Goldman predicting an additional 2% rise after the S&P 500 exceeded its previous target. This would cap off an already strong year, with the index up more than 20%. A key driver behind the forecasts for continued stock price growth is the expectation that a broader range of industries will contribute to the market's rise. However, in reality, indexes like the S&P 500 remain largely dependent on investor enthusiasm for tech, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence. On that note, the bank also pointed to a recovering microchip supply chain, which is expected to lift profits for both chipmakers and tech giants as they develop new AI applications.

While historical performance isn’t always a reliable indicator, seasonal trends suggest that Q4 often boosts the broader U.S. markets, partly driven by increased consumer spending during the holiday season. Market analysts also note that growth stocks tend to perform well when global interest rates reverse course. However, Adam Parker, CEO of Trivariate Research, shared in an interview with CNBC that he feels more pessimistic about growth stocks compared to his outlook before August 5 lows, citing the unusual market conditions and a slight dip in corporate earnings growth projections.
Moreover, despite high expectations that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve would boost the stock market, this hasn’t materialized as anticipated. Investors seem to be increasingly sensitive to growth concerns amid a global landscape marked by the U.S. presidential election, Middle East instability, and an uncertain Fed rate outlook for next year. While the Fed has hinted at more rate cuts, moving too quickly could jeopardize inflation goals. Regarding this, analysts at Stifel made the following remarks:
""The conclusion … is that if the Fed cuts rates in 2025 absent a recession (two 25's as this year comes to a close do not count) then that would be a mistake, with investors paying the price in latter 2025 / 2026, based on historical precedent.""
In terms of making money in the stock market, most investors are naturally drawn to growth stocks. While defensive investments are gaining traction due to global economic slowdown, Andrew Slimmon of Morgan Stanley Investment Management advises against this approach. These sentiments emphasize that high-growth stocks can outperform the market and deliver strong returns even if the stock fluctuates during the short term. Many of these stocks have shown impressive revenue growth and, with key catalysts in place, may continue to outperform.
Additionally, hedge funds see the most promising growth stocks as those positioned to benefit from rising consumer purchasing power. As the Fed aims for a soft economic landing, consumer cyclical stocks may gain, bolstered by improved consumer spending. Rate cuts should also support growth and tech stocks, setting the stage for potential gains across these sectors. In that same vein, the average annual return for the 500 largest-cap companies has consistently exceeded 10%, giving investors strong confidence to favor the stock market over more conservative options like bonds or fixed-income securities.
Our Methodology
In this article, we compiled a list of the top growth stocks with year-to-date gains exceeding 20%. These hot stocks to buy are ranked in ascending order based on hedge fund sentiment, offering a clear view of which growth stocks are most favored by institutional investors.
At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Year-To-Date Gain as of November 6: 55.63%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 130
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global leader in technology, specializing in semiconductor design and enterprise software. The company's product lineup includes cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters, catering to diverse markets such as data centers, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless.
BofA Securities reaffirmed its Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a price target of $215, following a meeting at Broadcom’s headquarters attended by CEO Hock Tan, CFO Kirsten Spears, and IR head Ji Yoo, which saw strong investor interest. The discussion focused on Broadcom’s growing presence in the artificial intelligence market. The company expects AI-related sales to contribute roughly $12 billion, or 24% of its total revenue, in fiscal year 2024. This growth comes from a total addressable market (TAM) projected between $100 billion and $125 billion, driven by increasing AI workload demands.
In the third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, reflecting a 47% increase year-over-year. This growth was fueled by robust AI-related revenue, strong VMware bookings, and stable non-AI semiconductor sales. For Q4 2024, Broadcom anticipates a 10% sequential increase in AI revenue to $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion, primarily driven by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.
Overall AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of the hot growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

One conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC’s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.

Nevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity’s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn’t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.
While that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.
“The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever”.
In light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called ""time testing compute"" for improving models during the “inference” phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.
Recent AI Developments
Fortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry’s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.
Story Continues
In its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn’t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot’s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.
In other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.
“Ad programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.”

20241113,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Will Go Higher in Trump Presidency. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer.
In a recent program, Jim Cramer celebrated the market’s rally on Donald Trump’s election victory, saying the market likes Trump.
“The market likes Donald J. Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?”
Cramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.
“Trump wants to cut taxes—all taxes—including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It’s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that’s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.”
Cramer said the market is still “oversold” as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground. However, Cramer said the polls were again proved wrong.
Cramer then talked about the stocks that investors can buy to ride the Trump rally.

20241113,NOW,"ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
Story Continues
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
ServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
ServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

The new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.
Real-time Transcription – Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents’ work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.
Unified Routing – Five9’s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9.

It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.
Single Agent Experience – Native Call Controls within ServiceNow’s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer’s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.

New Now Assist capabilities drive greater visibility and controls with AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices
Native multilingual support extends global footprint for seamless, culturally aware GenAI communications and translations
Purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety
SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, today announced new generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to advance autonomous, responsible AI on the Now Platform. With this launch, ServiceNow is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio for customers. This includes new, expanded Now Assist capabilities that drive greater visibility and controls with an AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices. Native multilingual support in Now Assist extends GenAI’s global footprint for seamless, culturally aware communications and translations. Finally, purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety.
As enterprises have accelerated the adoption of GenAI, they are discovering that siloed applications and scattered data are barriers to impact and that establishing clearly defined, human-centric governance processes are essential to the effective use and oversight of GenAI. That’s why ServiceNow delivers a winning combination of one platform with an integrated data layer and continues to optimize its AI platform for speed, scale, and security. The single architecture of the Now Platform helps ensure strong governance is embedded in its Now Assist GenAI solutions, models, and agents no matter where they are deployed in an organization.
""Enterprises across every industry are embracing a future of greater autonomy and productivity, all in service to their employees, customers, and overall business impact,"" said Jon Sigler, senior vice president of Platform and AI at ServiceNow. ""The ServiceNow platform was built to empower this transformation, offering smarter, faster ways of working through AI-enabled automation. With governance at the core, these new innovations bring more personalized, collaborative, trusted experiences to life across the enterprise.""
Elevating customer trust with integrated AI governance
Teams working with AI are often burdened with siloed tools and systems, making visibility and AI governance difficult. AI governance requires the integration of complex business processes and needs a best-of-breed workflow platform to be implemented successfully. With a unified AI inventory data model for connecting AI strategy, technology, security, and compliance to operate as an AI control tower, and expanded oversight for AI Governance for Now Assist, ServiceNow is laying a foundation to help customers build trust while accelerating business transformation.

ServiceNow also introduced new Now Assist capabilities that empower customers with the tools needed for responsible AI use:
Now Assist Guardian provides built-in monitoring and responsible AI guardrails so customers can better control the use of GenAI on the Now Platform. This includes the management and mitigation of offensive content, security vulnerabilities, and the exposure of sensitive information.
Now Assist Data Kit eases the often-cumbersome task of managing and consuming data for AI use cases. Users can create and easily manage datasets for AI skills and applications, develop ground truth datasets to benchmark for accuracy and help predict AI outcomes, and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of experiences built with Now Assist Skill Kit.
Now Assist Analytics offers greater visibility into the adoption, usage, and performance of Now Assist across the enterprise. With these insights, customers can make more informed, data-driven decisions to advance GenAI adoption, evaluate ROI on GenAI investments, and enable better business outcomes.
Extending the value and impact of GenAI globally
With today’s launch, ServiceNow is adding new built-in multilingual features to Now Assist. These new features address customer demand and expand the application of ServiceNow’s GenAI solutions in global markets. Now Assist can now generate, summarize, and respond to GenAI prompts in the user’s native language, providing improved, culturally aware understanding and communication for both agents and requestors.
The following languages are supported natively by Now Assist: English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese. Other languages will continue to be supported with ServiceNow’s existing Dynamic Translation, which automatically translates user inputs and a response back in the user’s language.
Accelerating productivity with tailored Now Assist solutions
Building on the Xanadu platform release—which marked the company’s most comprehensive set of AI innovations to date—ServiceNow has further expanded Now Assist solutions, purpose-built for specific enterprise use cases. From configuration management to legal affairs and health and safety, GenAI can help transform the productivity and efficacy of these critical internal functions.
Now Assist for Configuration Management Database (CMDB) uses AI to make managing and understanding data easier for customers. It helps users keep a clean and accurate CMDB by reducing duplicate data, simplifying complex information, and streamlining data input. With Now Assist for CMDB, users can quickly view summaries of Configuration Items (CIs) and their dependencies, and AI can find and fix duplicate data automatically. It also assists in the setup of Service Graph Connectors to bring data into the CMDB and fix any issues that come up during the process.
Now Assist for Legal Service Delivery helps legal teams deliver faster service to clients with auto-generated summaries of legal requests and matters. Legal teams are often juggling multiple requests and complex legal matters, such as investigations, simultaneously. With Now Assist, they can fulfill these requests with greater efficiency and faster time to resolution.
Now Assist in Contract Management streamlines contract processing and reduces risk by leveraging GenAI to automatically flag non-standard language, identify missing clauses and suggest revisions within contracts such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Additionally, GenAI provides rapid insights into contractual terms and obligations by intelligently extracting metadata from contracts. This helps reduce cost, revenue leakage, and risk for the enterprise.
Now Assist for Health and Safety helps ensure a safer environment for employees by streamlining incident management processes while reducing manual, repetitive work for health and safety workers. It uses GenAI to auto-generate summaries of safety incidents and lessons learned based on incident records, resulting in more effective communication, improved agent productivity, and proactive prevention and resolution of incidents.
In addition to these new innovations, ServiceNow Impact—the ServiceNow customer success solution to maximize AI, optimize performance, provide on-demand expertise, and accelerate business value—includes new GenAI accelerators to help make adoption of Now Assist solutions easier and faster for customers.
""Worldwide spending on AI is projected to grow 3 times greater than the five-year CAGR for worldwide IT spending over the same period (2023-2028), driven by the rapid infusion of AI and GenAI for employee experience, customer engagement, business processes, and industry innovation,"" said Ritu Jyoti, general manager/group VP, AI, and Data market research and advisory at IDC. ""As organizations look to drive value from AI transformations, they recognize the need for a single and scalable platform that connects people, processes, data, and systems. ServiceNow is meeting customers where they are by streamlining workflows and simplifying complex processes on a single AI-powered platform. As ServiceNow expands GenAI into new areas of the enterprise, the company continues to help organizations transform operations and stay competitive.""
Customers like EY are already seeing the benefits of Now Assist.
""GenAI is having a huge impact on our organization, both in the way EY teams deliver EY services and support EY people, but also in creating opportunities to go to market with ServiceNow to help EY clients transform their businesses,"" said Hank Prybylski, Global Vice Chair, Transformation, EY. ""We are seeing incredible value in the Now Assist space and looking to extend that to a whole suite of areas including customer service management and more broadly to our managed services environment.""
Putting data and AI to work across the Now Platform
On top of today’s launch, ServiceNow recently announced Workflow Data Fabric, a breakthrough innovation that enhances all ServiceNow workflows, AI solutions, and AI Agents.
This enhanced, integrated data layer allows customers to connect, understand, and act on structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data across the enterprise, inside and outside of ServiceNow. Coupled with zero copy capabilities and the future integration of Knowledge Graph, which transforms raw data into contextual insights, ServiceNow is unifying people, processes, operations, and systems so AI can work more autonomously across the enterprise.
These data capabilities are an instrumental part of ServiceNow's vision of AI Agents that work autonomously and collaboratively with people to enable business transformation. This vision also includes the expansion of its partnership with NVIDIA to jointly develop AI agent use cases on the Now Platform and accelerate the adoption of Agentic AI, reinventing how AI delivers value across all industries.
Availability
AI Governance for Now Assist is available today to a limited set of customers and is expected to be generally available in Q1 2025. All other new GenAI innovations announced today are now generally available to customers in the ServiceNow Store.

20241113,NOW,"Investing.com - Cloud software providers are expected to see a recovery in customer spending as a resilient economic environment pushes more businesses to invest in their artificial intelligence-powered technologies, according to analysts at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and peer Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) have also been pouring money into building out their own AI capabilities and folding them into their products, although investors have raised concerns around the timeline for the pay off from these expenditures.
In a note to clients, the Wells Fargo analysts led by Michael Turrin argued that ServiceNow is among the few software comapnies ""demonstrating tangible AI monetization,"" adding they expect the group to ""play offense"" in AI customer service. Businesses use ServiceNow's AI-backed products to automate and manage their IT processes and reduce costs.
Last month, ServiceNow unveiled a fourth-quarter subscription revenue forecast that topped Wall Street expectations.
The firm, which has been rolling out new AI-enhanced offerings to its enterprise clients such as ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and video conferencing service Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), also increased its full-year subscription revenue outlook thanks to solid demand from new and existing customers.
Meanwhile, ServiceNow's rival Salesforce has yet to show enough evidence its own AI offering will be enough to return growth to double-digits in the near term, the Wells Fargo analysts said.
In August, the software-as-a-service pioneer reported better-than-anticipated revenue of $9.33 billion in its second quarter and raised its annual profit outlook to a range of $10.03 to $10.11 per share, up from $9.86 to $9.94. But Salesforce's guidance for third-quarter revenue still missed expectations, exacerbating worries around a potential rebound in cloud spending.
The Wells Fargo analysts said they see more ""attractive opportunities"" in companies like ServiceNow that have already shown an ability to make money off of so-called generative AI. The setup for Salesforce heading into next is ""tough,"" they added.

20241113,NOW,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.
That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.
However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.
ServiceNow (NOW) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations a great growth pick right now.
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 6.7%.
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.4%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.
Story Continues
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
The current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.2% over the past month.
Bottom Line
ServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

20241113,NOW,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Innovative Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.
Technology is a Big Deal, Strategist Highlights
The Magnificent Seven continues to grasp a sizeable market share of the market gains over the past few years. That said, investors and analysts are excited to see what this earnings period has to offer for the magnificent seven and how much of an influence they have on the market. On October 31, Christian Dery, head of macro strategy at Capital Fund Management, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the impact of the magnificent seven on the market.
Dery suggested that these companies have grown to become large entities and their market capitalization often fluctuates by $2 billion to $400 billion on earnings events. Looking at the dispersion of the index, Dery adds that individual stocks within the S&P are very diverse and more independent, hinting towards a very low correlation in the index.
He adds that generative AI and LLMs are very different from the traditional software business. Therefore, the hyperscaling model that is conventionally taken from software can not be applied here. For every new customer in the software business, the marginal cost often goes down to nearly zero. However, if you look at the “tech incumbents”, they have to increase their capital expenditures to develop compute clusters and scale their operations, suggests Dery.
In 2023, the chips industry generated revenue of about $3 billion, reflecting that we are yet to find a killer use case or see results of generous AI spending. Dery adds that the market is more likely to be “discerning” on the path to profitability since companies are going to focus more on capital expenditures and projections for capital expenditures. He is particularly interested in the CapEx projections of the Magnificent Seven and shares that if they miss there could be a negative reaction among those stocks.
Dery reiterated that the market is yet to see the investments pay off multiple times but maintains his interest in capital expenditures by these companies playing out. While he is bullish on technological innovation and believes artificial intelligence is disruptive and a “big deal”, he fails to see viable results as of now. Dery also emphasizes that these companies are directing their investments to AI because they do not want to fall behind competitors, with no proper timeline for AI monetization.

ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97
ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software company that helps companies manage digital workflows and operations using its cloud computing platform. The company’s Now Platform allows businesses to leverage AI to enhance productivity, automate workflows, scale for growth, and improve security.
In the third quarter of 2024, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) generated $2.79 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from the same quarter in 2023. Of this, subscription revenue was worth $2.72 billion, representing a growth rate of 23%. The company attributes this momentum to customers doubling down on ServiceNow as a leading AI platform for operational efficacy and business transformation. The company itself is confident in its future performance as the demand for AI continues to grow.
During the quarter, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) processed its largest AI release to date, the Now Platform Xanadu release. The release encompasses hundreds of new and improved AI capabilities and generative AI solutions for the telecom, media, technology, and financial services industries. In addition to that, the company also partnered with NVIDIA to co-develop AI agents using Nvidia’s blueprints in the ServiceNow platform. To align with its expansion strategy, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) also forged separate partnerships with Siemens, Rimini Street, and Pearson to develop AI use cases for different industries and customer segments.
Overall, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an investor favorite because of its quality deals with major players in the industry. Similarly, the company has high growth expectations for the full fiscal year and the fourth quarter of 2024, contributing to its ranking as one of the best innovative stocks according to hedge funds.
Ithaka Group’ Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Founded in 2004, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has become the leading provider of cloud-based software solutions that define, structure, manage and automate workflow services for global enterprises. ServiceNow pioneered the use of the cloud to deliver IT service management (“ITSM”) applications. These applications allow users to manage incidents and to plan new IT projects, provision clouds, manage application performance and build applications themselves. The company has since expanded beyond the ITSM market to provide workflow solutions for IT operations management, customer support, human resources, security operations and other enterprise departments where a patchwork of semi-automated processes have been used with varying success in the past. ServiceNow’s stock appreciated in the quarter on the back of strong earnings that beat Street estimates on the top and bottom line, with the company pointing to strength in subscription revenues, cRPO, operating margins, and continued demand for the company’s AI products.”
Overall, NOW ranks 9th on our list of best innovative stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Chicago, IL – November 5, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Arista Networks ANET, Tesla TSLA and ServiceNow NOW.
3 Momentum Stocks About to Surge (TSLA, NOW, ANET)
One of my favorite ways to pick winning stocks by combining two of the most effective methods out there; the Zacks Rank and momentum. The Zacks Rank is a highly effective quantitative strategy that aggregates all analyst ratings of a stock and converts them into a simple ranking. Momentum is one of the most well documented edge and is well known as a premier anomaly for investors to utilize for successful trading.
Together, these two techniques have helped me detect dozens of huge winners in the stock market and right now they have identified three highly compelling stock picks. Arista Networks, Tesla and ServiceNow all boast a top Zacks Rank and an A+ technical momentum setup, leading me to believe that they may be huge winners in the coming weeks and months.
Tesla: Bullish Setup and Strong Buy Stock
Tesla stock has been on a rather volatile and uncertain path this year as electric vehicle sales have slowed markedly. However, CEO Elon Musk is a master of surprising to the upside, and with humanoid robots, self-driving cars and a multitude of other side-bets within Tesla, there is always the potential for a huge run in the stock.
Over the last two months, analysts have started to upgrade their earnings estimates for Tesla, and it now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 13.4% over the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have jumped by 7.5% over the same period.
But most notable is the technical chart pattern forming in Tesla stock price. After gapping higher following its quarterly earnings report, the price action has been building a highly compelling descending wedge. If the stock can trade above the $250 level, it would signal a breakout and may send the stock on another major bull run. Alternatively, if it loses the $240 level of support, the pattern will be invalidated, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.
Arista Networks: Stock Breaking out Now
Arista Networks, a leading provider of high-performance networking solutions primarily for data centers and cloud computing, is another stock to watch. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, ANET also boasts strong earnings growth forecasts and sits in the top 13% of the Zacks Industry Rank.
Over the next three to five years, Arista Networks is projected to increase its earnings per share by an impressive 15.3% annually. Sales are also expected to grow nicely, with estimates of a 16.3% increase this year and 17.4% next year.
Story Continues
Arista Networks stock is also breaking out of its technical pattern today. After building out a bull flag over the last month, ANET is staging a clear breakout. If the stock can hold above the $400 level, it should be the start of another rally. However, if it reverses and loses the breakout level, it may be a sign that the stock needs more time before climbing higher.
ServiceNow: Poised for Growth and a Bullish Breakout
ServiceNow is a cloud computing company that offers a suite of software solutions for IT service management, human resources, customer service, and more. These products help organizations automate routine tasks, enhance productivity, and improve employee and customer experience.
ServiceNow is a rapidly growing technology company that also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Earnings are projected to grow 24.7% annually over the next three to five years, while sales are expected to climb 22.3% this year and 20.1% next year.
Like the other two stocks, NOW stock looks to be developing a very bullish technical pattern. After beating earnings estimates and gapping higher, the price action has been consolidating into a picture-perfect bull flag. Today, NOW stock is bumping up against the upper level of resistance, and if it can break out above the $955 level, it should send the stock significantly higher. However, if it loses the $930 level of support, investors may want to hold off and wait for other opportunities.
Should Investors Buy NOW, ANET and TSLA Shares?
The current setups for Arista Networks, Tesla, and ServiceNow are quite convincing, blending strong fundamental growth with technical momentum. Each company boasts robust earnings growth forecasts, competitive market positions, and favorable chart patterns, making them solid candidates for those seeking high-potential momentum plays.
For investors with an appetite for growth and momentum, NOW, ANET, and TSLA offer a balanced blend of technical and fundamental indicators suggesting strong performance ahead. As always, keeping an eye on key price levels and being a keen risk manager will be key for trading them successfully.

OpenAI, the AI startup of ChatGPT fame, recently urged the United States government and allies to come together to develop the AI infrastructure needed to compete with China. According to a report published by Bloomberg, the startup has said that the US and neighboring countries should form a North American Compact for AI that can streamline access to talent, financing and supply chains for building out the technology. The company further added this collaboration could later expand to include a global network of US allies and partners, including countries in the Middle East.

At an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, the startup issued a new policy blueprint, saying that the US should backstop energy infrastructure projects by committing to purchase power from them. The company further urged the US to establish AI Economic Zones that speed up the permitting process and help bring nuclear reactors back online. It also proposed expanding nuclear energy capacity by tapping the US Navy, which has built compact reactors to power submarines. The company is already working with Microsoft to set up an AI fund needed to develop AI chips, energy and data centers.

20241115,META,"(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump’s election victory, as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.

There’s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump’s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.
But there’s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate — especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect — and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.
These cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk’s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up just over 2%, while Facebook parent Meta is up less than 1%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 6%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 3.3%.
As the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they’re thinking about. Here’s what they’re saying:
Tiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:
“Tariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.
We have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.”
Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott
Story Continues
“The market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we’ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.
I don’t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.”
Mark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.
“The regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she’s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.”
Threats against Alphabet and Meta are “just talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn’t take kindly to that. However, I don’t think anything like this will make it into policy.”
Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management
“Trump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn’t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn’t put him the best light.
The thing that’s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That’s a counter perspective to that. We’ll see.”
Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management
“I don’t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn’t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren’t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.
I don’t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined. I have exposure to Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple. I don’t know how tariffs will impact Nvidia, since the demand will remain there no matter what. Broadcom goes kind of hand in hand with that. I think that at Apple, Cook will take steps to keep the products from exploding in price.”
Adam Grossman, chief investment officer of global equity at Riverfront Investment Group:
“It’s still unclear a week after the election. I do think he could get tariffs through on China, but getting tariffs through on Europe, that’s another ball of wax.
For someone like Donald Trump, I think he’s going to have enough other issues that they’re going to kind of fly off of his radar.”

20241115,META,"The deluge of goodbye messages from people leaving X began shortly after Donald Trump's election victory last week. In explaining their decision, many in the exodus cited the same thing: The huge support Elon Musk, the social media service's owner, gave the Republican candidate during the campaign and the increasing nastiness on his site.
Jody Avrigan, a podcast host and media producer with 50,000 followers on X, said on rival social media service Threads, that he was done using X, because “Elon Musk is a pretty destructive force in our society and politics, I want no part of him.” Nicole Wallace, an anchor on MSNBC with over 1 million followers on X, said on live TV that she’d “deleted Twitter today as an act of self preservation.” Tee Wattress said on Threads she'd been on X for 15 years sharing comedic takes on pop culture and reality TV, but ""to see it turn into the hell scape that it is today has been devastating."" Even the author and very active X user Stephen King joined Threads, telling his 7 million X followers that he was leaving the platform. ""Tried to stay, but the atmosphere has just become too toxic.""
The large number of people swearing off X for other services may spell the end to social media as we know it. Instead of just of a tiny number of extremely popular sites for posting news, opinions, and memes, as has been the case for more than a decade, a number of new options are gaining millions of users, such Threads, owned by Facebook parent Meta, and Bluesky.
Daily users of X, previously known as Twitter, have declined consistently since Musk acquired it in 2022. Last year, it had roughly 250 million daily active users and Musk claimed that the total would grow to 1 billion in 2024. On election day last week, X had only 162 million daily users—and even that was a yearly high, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm that tracks the platform. A day later, that number had already dropped by 5 million, to 157 million daily users.
Under Musk's ownership, X has lost an average of 14% of its users monthly, according to Sensor Tower. Despite the slight boost in daily users on the day of the election, an “elongated slide in active users” has continued, Sensor Tower’s research lead Seema Shah told Fortune.
Shortly after taking over X, Musk made major changes to the platform to advance what he described as ""free speech,"" whittling down the hundreds of people that once worked on content moderation for Twitter to just a handful of contract employees, reinstating openly white supremacist or otherwise vitriolic personalities, and boosting only accounts that paid to be verified, effectively gamifying the entire platform. He also tilted the algorithm to favor inflammatory posts and conservative flash points, gleefully joining the fray himself, often passing along political and racial conspiracy theories to his 200 million followers.
Story Continues
Late in the recent presidential campaign, Musk overtly joined forces with Trump by campaigning for him and donating heavily to ensure a Trump victory, using X as a tool to that end. He has since been by Trump’s side in Florida and has been rewarded by the President-elect as the co-head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, which shares an acronym with a cryptocurrency Musk often promotes.
For many users, such a platform, whatever it may have once been, is no longer fun or useful. And it's set off the latest chorus of people proclaiming their exit from X—for good this time, even if many have decided to keep their accounts live, but vow not to post anything more on them.
“There has been a steady drift away from X for a while,” Jonathan Bellack, senior director of Harvard University’s Applied Social Media Lab that’s part of the Berkman Klein Center, told Fortune. “And yes, we’re seeing more people doing it more loudly at the moment, but people have been leaving for months and months. Now, I wonder if people are choosing to leave because of their beliefs, or because the experience on the platform has gotten worse.”
This X diaspora has coincided with the rising influence of other forms of media, like podcasts, long-form video, group chats, and comments sections on YouTube and Discord, for instance. It's also come amid the increasing adoption of newly-founded social media platforms. Today, many public personalities and journalists—long the backbone of Twitter and X—post the same thing across Threads, Bluesky, and X, hedging their bets on what may go viral where.
For years, Twitter enjoyed near immunity from new rivals because its network effect was so strong. The more people who used it, the more useful it became and the more others therefore wanted to join. That flywheel spun for a long time, keeping social media startups and even behemoths like Meta, from even attempting to directly compete. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg quipped a decade ago that Twitter was ""a clown car that drove into a goldmine."" When Musk started to take the wheels off of Twitter, Zuckerberg put 15 engineers to work building a veritable clone now known as Threads.
Whatever people’s reasons for leaving X, the two most likely places for people to land is either Threads or Bluesky, a startup initiated by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Both platforms debuted last year and are currently jockeying for first and second place in Apple’s App store for most-downloaded free apps in the U.S. TikTok and WhatsApp, also owned by Meta, are in the top 10 as well. Meanwhile, X is in 29th place, behind other social apps like Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta.
No third party research service tracks when users delete an app from their phone. But SimilarWeb found that at least 115,000 users deactivated their X accounts via the web the day after the recent election. That same day, Google Search interest in the phrase ""Delete X"" rose 150% and has continued to grow by double digit percentage points each day since, according to Huge, a design and technology company that conducts custom research. Even news outlet The Guardian said this week it was abandoning all 80 of his official accounts, with a collective 27 million followers, due to the increase in “disturbing content promoted or found on the platform.""
Another data point is anecdotal: Over the past week, many top X users say they’ve lost significant numbers of followers, ranging from dozens to hundreds or even thousands. Brent Troderian, who has over 150,000 followers on X, said on Threads that he’s lost about 1,000 followers since the election. Another well-known figure on X, Aaron Rupar, who writes a newsletter on politics and media, said he hemorrhaged 10,000 of his nearly 1 million followers last week. “While I'm not above a bad tweet or two, I don't think it's anything I posted,” he wrote.
Although there has been speculation online that some of these declines could be related to bots or inauthentic accounts suddenly leaving or being deleted from the platform, there is no clear evidence to support the notion.
In any case, such follower losses coincide with growth in activity on rival platforms. New users of Threads in the last month grew 394% year over year, according to Sensor Tower. Meta said in October the service had reached 275 million monthly active users. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram who also oversees Threads, said Thursday that the platform had added another 15 million users so far in November, and was ""going on three months with more than a million sign ups a day.""
While Bluesky has far fewer users, it's been a trending topic on X and Threads over the last week as people discussed where there were heading while leaving X. Since the election, it has added almost 1 million new users, to a total of nearly 15 million.
TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat have all added users as well each month over the last year, from 3% to 10%, according to Sensor Tower.
Despite all of the apparent momentum away from X, and the manipulation of its content algorithm in favor of right-wing politics and Musk himself, at least some of the people who may be leaving X are being replaced by new users. It’s possible there is a sort of swap going on—use among people fed up with the pro-Trump drift and Musk's omnipresence is, to some extent, being covered by people who are attracted to exactly that.
“Although X has experienced this elongated decline in overall US active users over the past few years, it has seen a sizable uptick in new users, or those who had previously never registered a session on X,” Shah of Sensor Tower told Fortune.
According to Sensor Tower, new mobile app users for X jumped 17% in October, among the few notable increases it’s seen since Musk’s takeover.
While this isn’t enough to offset X’s sustained loss in users since Musk’s acquisition, the overall migration among social media platforms is part and parcel to a new era of online fragmentation. This online splintering is taking with it some of the cultural and media power that had coalesced around what was Twitter, according to Bellack of Harvard, and it’s likely that no one platform or type of media will take up that position ever again.
“Twitter always had a level of influence that was disproportionate to its number of users – it had a public square feeling, yes, but there’s no reason that’s the only way social media can work,” Bellack said. “People leaving X, the fragmentation and people sorting themselves in other places, it’s just reinforcing the notion that there will no longer be one definitive platform, and that’s probably a good thing.”

20241115,META,"Catherine Mann warned of ‘damaging economic effects and increase volatility’ - Hollie Adams/Bloomberg
A Bank of England rate-setter has warned that Donald Trump’s trade war could hit growth and push up consumer prices in the UK.
Catherine Mann, who sits on the Monetary Policy Committee deciding interest rates, said the splintering of the world economy would “likely put upward pressure on costs and prices”.
Her remarks at the Annual Conference of the Society of Professional Economists in London come as Mr Trump is poised to re-enter the White House in January on a mandate of cutting taxes by aggressively raising tariffs.
Ms Mann said that even uncertainty more broadly about trade policy risked having “damaging economic effects and increase volatility”.
She said: “The latest political developments across the Atlantic have not made a disorderly trade scenario less likely, which would have consequences for output and inflation in the UK.”
The rate-setter is known as the hawk-in-chief on the Bank of England’s nine-person panel setting interest rates, preferring higher borrowing costs when faced with uncertainty.
Ms Mann said that factors like protectionism, climate change and higher government spending could trigger more unstable inflation in coming years.
This will lead to higher interest rates in the long-term, she believes.

Trump’s transition team aims to kill Biden’s tax credit for electric cars
President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is discussing killing a $7,500 (£5,900) consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation, according to sources who spoke with Reuters.
Ending the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling transition to electric cars in the US.
Earlier this year, Elon Musk, one of Trump’s biggest backers and the world’s richest person, said: “It would be devastating for our competitors, and it would hurt Tesla slightly but long term probably actually helps Tesla would be my guess”.
Separately, on X, he wrote: “Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla.”
Repealing the subsidy, which has been a signature measure of Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team, the sources said.
Donald Trump repeatedly pledged to end Mr Biden’s “EV mandate” on the campaign trail.

One of Britain’s oldest tea companies lines up administrators
Typhoo Tea, one of Britain’s oldest tea companies, is close to falling into administration after years of setbacks including a costly break-in at its Wirral factory.
Typhoo has filed a notice to appoint administrators, according to court filings on Thursday. The step can be used by companies to give them some breathing space from creditors to try to pay back their debts.
It is understood Typhoo is using the process to explore rescue options, with administrators from EY lined up. The court notice does not mean that Typhoo is in administration.
Typhoo, which was founded in 1903 by Birmingham grocer John Sumner, was once one of the UK’s best-selling tea brands.
However, sales have struggled in recent years. Revenues fell from £34m in 2022 to £25m last year, while losses ballooned to £38m from £9.7m a year earlier, according to publicly available accounts.
The steep jump in losses came after the company suffered a break-in at its mothballed factory in Merseyside, which involved “extensive damage” to machinery and tea stock. This delayed the sale of the factory, which was then completed in June 2024.

European stocks jump as energy and tech lead the charge
Europe’s Stoxx 600 bounced back with a 1.1pc gain, driven by strong performances in the energy and technology sectors, while positive earnings reports added to the upbeat mood.
The pan-European index was, none the less, pinned near a three-month low, after falling in the previous two sessions.
ASML gained 6.9pc after Europe’s largest tech firm said it expects sales to grow by 8pc-14pc over the coming five years, boosting the tech sub-sector 3.1pc.
Telecoms was among the top five major gainers in the sub-sectors, adding 1.8pc, while heavyweight energy stocks advanced 1.7pc.
Deutsche Telekom advanced 3.3pc after Europe’s largest telecoms group by market capitalisation raised its full-year core profit forecast and marginally beat third-quarter core profit expectations.

Reeves’s tax raid could spell end of the barman, says pub boss
Rachel Reeves’s £25bn tax raid on businesses could mean last orders for bartenders, industry chiefs have suggested, as higher costs prompt pubs to rely more on apps.
Simon Dodd, the chief executive of pub group Young’s, said he planned to increase the use of app and tablet-based ordering to save money after large increases in employers’ National Insurance (NI) contributions and National Living Wage in the Budget.
Mr Dodd said: “We have our app, which we have over a million customers on. How can we make that more efficient? How can we make order at the table more efficient? How can we use [devices] like tablets?”
The pub chief stressed that Young’s was not looking at job cuts but wanted to drive “efficiencies” through technology. His comments suggest pubs could keep the same number of staff but focus them on delivering food and drink to tables rather than handling orders at the bar.
Such a system may enable them to get through a higher volume of orders, helping to increase revenues while keeping costs stable.
Mr Dodd is the latest pub chief to raise the prospect of fewer bartenders as a result of the Budget. The British Institute of Innkeeping (BII), which represents the pub sector, has said that three quarters of its members plan to cut staff hours, meaning fewer people would be working at any given time.

Apple AirPods stifle growth in headphone market, says WH Smith boss
Apple’s AirPods have killed off newness in the headphone market, the boss of WH Smith has said, as it plans to switch in more power banks and charging cables into its airport stores.
Carl Cowling, the chief executive of WH Smith, said: “Everybody has AirPods now. That has become the headphone market in many ways and has stifled growth elsewhere.”
WH Smith said this meant there was less innovation coming through from makers of headphones, prompting a rethink of what it stocks in its airline stores.
The retailer has 256 stores in airports, including its magazine and book stores, and 124 InMotion stores, which sell technology products.
WH Smith said it will now be tripling the space set aside in the InMotion stores for its own range of “tech accessors” such as battery packs, cables and chargers.
Mr Cowling said: “If you’re in an InMotion store in an airport today, we’ve probably got about three metres of that product. If you go in this time next year, you’ll see 10 metres.”
Mr Cowling said the company would be bringing a “designer edge” to these accessories.
It follows years where Apple has moved ahead in the headphone market. According to Kantar figures, around 27pc of people who have wireless headphones use Apple products, compared to 6pc who use Beats and 6pc who use Bose.

US stocks flat as inflation concerns linger
Wall Street indexes are sliding around close to flat this afternoon, with investors digesting inflation data which added to concerns that price increases might remain sticky.
Patrick O’Hare of Briefing.com said:
The economic data released this morning is causing a bit of a stir and a little bit of pause because it’s demonstrating that inflation at the producer level is sticky itself.
The producer price index climbed 0.2pc last month according to Labor Department data, accelerating from September.
From a year ago, wholesale prices rose 2.4pc, up as well from September’s figure.
This could give the Federal Reserve some pause as it tries to balance its fight against inflation with a healthy jobs market.
“The higher interest rates, I think, are kind of acting as a headwind of sorts for the equity market right now,” Mr O’Hare added.

Ford hit with penalty over slow car recalls
Ford will pay a penalty of up to $165m (£130m) to the US government for moving too slowly on a recall and failing to give accurate recall information.
The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said that the civil penalty is the second-largest in its 54-year history.

The agency says Ford was too slow to recall vehicles with faulty rear view cameras, and it failed to give the agency complete information, as required by law.

Under the order, an independent third party will oversee the automaker’s recall performance obligations for at least three years.
The carmaker told The Telegraph: “We appreciate the opportunity to resolve this matter with NHTSA and remain committed to continuously improving safety and compliance at Ford.
“Wide-ranging enhancements are already underway with more to come, including advanced data analytics, a new in-house testing facility, among other capabilities.”

ECB policymakers divided on inflation risks, say minutes
European Central Bank policymakers were divided at their meeting last month about the risks of inflation coming in too low over a sustained period, according to minutes released today.
The ECB lowered rates in October after also cutting the previous month. These were its first back-to-back reductions in the current easing cycle, as eurozone growth worries increasingly outweigh inflation concerns.
Data released before the last meeting showed eurozone consumer prices rose by 1.7pc in September, the first time in three years the figure had dipped below the central bank’s two-percent target.
That fired debate about whether the ECB had waited too long to start cutting borrowing costs, and whether there was now a risk of inflation falling well below target for a long time.
At the October meeting, while policymakers agreed inflation would settle at around two percent earlier than previous forecasts for the end of 2025, some argued that “a large, persistent undershooting” of the target was unlikely.
Factors needed to cause it were not present, such as “disappointing economic growth that moved into recessionary territory, a weakening in the financial system, wage pressures fading away”, according to the account of the gathering.
Others however worried that recent falls in inflation had been stronger than expected and said there was “an increasing risk of undershooting the target in the course of 2025, possibly in a sustained manner”.
“This could now be seen as a greater risk than overshooting the target,” they believed.
Since the ECB’s last meeting however, data have been released showing that eurozone inflation rose to two percent in October, more strongly than expected.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the minutes showed concerns about the weak eurozone economy were now clearly overtaking those about inflation.

The Onion buys conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s Infowars
The parody website The Onion has bought conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ Infowars brand and website in a bankruptcy auction, court documents show.
Jones filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022 after courts ordered him to pay $1.5bn for defaming the families of 20 students and six staff members killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
Unable to pay those legal judgments, Jones was forced to auction his assets, including Infowars, in bankruptcy.
“They’re shutting us down,” Jones said in a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. “I’m going to be here until they come in here and turn the lights off.”
The Connecticut families of eight victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting backed the Onion’s bid, saying it would put “an end to the misinformation machine” that Jones operated.
The Onion will acquire Infowars’ intellectual property, including its website, customer lists and inventory, certain social media accounts and Jones’ Infowars’ production equipment, the families said.

B&M billionaire Bobby Arora to step down next year
B&M billionaire Bobby Arora will step down from the value retailer next year, despite having agreed a £16m “golden handcuff” package to stay until 2026.
B&M said Mr Arora would retire next March from his role as trading director after almost 20 years.
Bobby, 52, was the last of the three Arora brothers to have an active role with the retail giant, which they had built from a struggling Northern chain in 2004 into a £3.9bn powerhouse.
It follows the exit of his brother Simon, who stepped down as chief executive of B&M in September last year. Simon had led B&M for 17 years.
Robin, the third brother, also had been involved with the discount retailer but no longer has an active role.
B&M boss Alex Russo said the decision for Mr Arora to step down came after the company “identified the right individual” to take up his role. Gareth Bilton, its UK store director, will be moving into the trading director post.
Mr Arora will be acting as an advisor for a “number of months” after his retirement, Mr Russo said.
However, he declined to give details of how much of the £16m bonus Mr Arora would receive by stepping down before 2026.
Mr Russo said: “When we make those decisions, that will be part of our accounts. I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to comment on anybody’s pay.”
According to the Sunday Times Rich List, Mr Arora and his family have a net worth of almost £2.7bn.

Meta hit with near €800m fine over classified ads business
The European Union has hit Facebook-owner Meta with a fine of nearly €800m (£665m) for what they call “abusive practices” involving its Marketplace business.
The European Commission issued the penalty after its long-running investigation found that the company abused its dominant position and engaged in anti-competitive behaviour in its online classified ads section.
The commission had accused Meta of distorting competition by tying Marketplace to its social network, automatically exposing Facebook users to the online classified ads section “whether they want it or not” and shutting out competitors.
It was also concerned that Meta was imposing unfair trading conditions with terms of service that authorised the company to use ad-related data to benefit Marketplace.
This data was generated from competing classified ad platforms who advertise on Facebook or Instagram.
Margrethe Vestager, the commission’s executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said Meta’s practices gave it “advantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match”.
She said: “This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour.”
Meta said in a statement that the decision fails to prove any “competitive harm” to rivals or consumers and “ignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services”.

Trader makes £5.2m bet on jumbo interest rate cut amid Trump tariff fears
A trader has bet that the eurozone is on the cusp of a jumbo-sized interest rate cut next month as policymakers brace for potential tariffs under Donald Trump’s presidency.
The investor has placed a bet that will pay out €6.25m (£5.2m) if the European Central Bank (ECB) announces an interest rate cut of three-quarters of a percentage point in December, according to Bloomberg.
The wager would also pay out if policymakers announce a half a point cut next month followed by a quarter point cut in January.
Mr Trump has pledged to impose tariffs on foreign goods entering the US market, promising levies of up to 60pc on goods from China.
ECB policymaker Joachim Nagel warned tariffs on European goods risk derailing the German economy, which has already been plunged into turmoil by the snap election called by chancellor Olaf Scholz.
Money markets have already priced in a quarter-point reduction by the ECB for next month but since last week’s US election the chances of a larger half-point cut have lifted to 28pc.
By contrast, Britain’s economy is expected to be relatively unscathed by the threat of tariffs under the incoming Trump administration.
Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “The UK is not as exposed to US import tariffs as many other economies and we suspect any resulting reduction in UK GDP would be very small.”

US unemployment claims fall to six-month low
The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in six months last week.
The Labor Department reported that jobless claim applications fell by 4,000 to 217,000 for the week of November 9, which was less than the 225,000 analysts forecast.
The four-week average of weekly claims, which evens out some of the weekly ups and downs, fell by 6,250 to 221,000.
Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered representative of US layoffs in a given week.
Continuing claims, the total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits, fell to 1.87m for the week of November 2, in line with analysts’ expectations.

US wholesale inflation rises more than expected
The rate of wholesale inflation in the US increased by more than expected ahead of the Donald Trump presidency, which is expected to increase pressure on prices.
The producer prices index (PPI) rose from 1.8pc in September to 2.4pc in October, which was higher than analysts had expected.
It comes after data on Wednesday showed consumer prices inflation rose from 2.4pc to 2.6pc last month.

Wall Street inches up ahead of Powell speech
US stock indexes edged higher as investors awaited a speech by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell later.
Mr Powell will provide an update on his economic outlook to business leaders in Dallas, a day after inflation figures showed consumer prices rose at an annual pace of 2.6pc in October, as expected.
Meanwhile, the producer price index (PPI) reading for October and weekly jobless claims data are expected shortly.
Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said: “These numbers (PPI) better reflect corporate pricing power than the consumer price data, the tone should be consistent with a December rate cut.”
Traders are broadly pricing in a 79pc chance of a quarter of a percentage point interest rate cut at the Fed’s December meeting.
Bets on a December cut increased after Wednesday’s consumer inflation data.
In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2pc, the S&P 500 was up 0.1pc and the Nasdaq 100 was little changed.

Disney claws back profit with films like Deadpool & Wolverine
Disney has reported better-than-expected profit in its latest quarter thanks to a strong rebound for the media giant’s film studio.
The House of Mouse posted a net profit of $460m (£363m) in its fourth quarter, up from $264m (£208m) in the same period last year.
The figures, which beat Wall Street expectations, came as Disney shrugged off recent troubles to enjoy one of the best quarters in the history of its studio.
New releases Inside Out 2 and Marvel blockbuster Deadpool & Wolverine helped drive a $316m profit in its content sales and licensing division.
Shares surged 10pc in premarket trading as Disney’s streaming division also performed strongly, generating its second straight quarter of profits. There are now 123m subscribers to the Disney+ service, excluding its Hotstar platform in India.
The figures suggest Disney is starting to reap the benefits of a turnaround plan implemented by chief executive Bob Iger. He has slashed costs at the media giant and refocused its efforts on quality of output over quantity following a string of box office flops.
Mr Iger said: “This was a pivotal and successful year for The Walt Disney Company, and thanks to the significant progress we’ve made, we have emerged from a period of considerable challenges and disruption well positioned for growth and optimistic about our future.”

Hopes of lower petrol prices as world faces looming oil glut
Motorists could face lower fuel prices next year amid an expected glut in oil supplies, the AA has said.
The world’s demand for oil will fall short of supply by more than one million barrels per day next year, the International Energy Agency has said.
Edmund King, AA president, told the Telegraph: “It is notoriously difficult to speculate on where oil prices might go in the next few months due to the considerable geo-political unrest; uncertainty about how Opec may react; and the US election.
“However, prices do generally reflect supply and demand and if the IEA predictions are correct, we could see pump price reductions in the new year due to a glut of oil.
“UK drivers and businesses were spared a fuel duty hike in the Budget so will be hoping for more good news in the new year with reduced prices at the pumps.”

Pound hits four-month low ahead of Reeves speech
The pound dropped to its lowest against the dollar since early July amid the US currency’s relentless rise following Donald Trump’s election victory.
Sterling was down as much as 0.6pc to $1.263, its lowest since July 2, amid expectations that the incoming US administration will enact inflationary policies, keeping interest rates higher.
Meanwhile, Rachel Reeves will deliver her first Mansion House speech to leaders of the City. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey will also speak.
Ms Reeves said in advance that she wants Britain to build a slew of “megafunds” with up to £80bn in fresh investment firepower, under plans for the biggest shake-up in British pensions seen in decades.

Gold slump deepens in ‘Trump trade’
Gold prices have fallen to a two-month low as the value of the dollar surged in the wake of the election of Donald Trump.
Bullion slipped as much as 1.8pc to less than $2,540 an ounce, which is its lowest point since September amid expectations the President-elect’s policies will boost economic growth and corporate profits.
There are also concerns his tariff plans will be inflationary and force the US Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer.
A stronger dollar - a beneficiary of so-called “Trump trades” since the election result - makes commodities priced in the currency more expensive for most buyers.
The pound was last down 0.3pc against the dollar to $1.271.

Britain’s migration surge ‘bigger than all other rich nations’
Britain saw the biggest surge in migration of any rich country last year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
A total of 746,900 new “permanent-type” migrants moved to the UK last year, the OECD said, up from 488,400 in 2022.
The 52.9pc year on year rise in migration outpaced all other OECD members. Of the wealthy nations that make up the OECD club, only South Korea had an increase anywhere near the UK’s level. Migration there rose by 50.9pc to 87,100 last year.

Reeves tax raid to deliver £11m hit to Young’s
Young’s expects to take an £11m annual hit from a rise in employer taxes announced in the Budget.
Chief executive Simon Dodd said the impact of a rise in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics), combined with an increase to the minimum wage, would result in “significant increased costs for our industry in the near term”.
The pub chain’s boss said: “We will work to see how we can mitigate these headwinds without passing on all the cost to our loyal customers.
“We would like to see certainty and delivery of real business rate reform which will benefit all hospitality businesses”
Young’s joins fellow pub group JD Wetherspoon in criticising the measures, announced by Rachel Reeves, with the latter’s boss, Tim Martin, saying costs would jump “substantially” as a result.
It comes as Young’s reported higher half-year profit, helped by a bump in sales from the Euros football tournament over the summer.
Pre-tax profit for the half ending September 30 was £25.3m, up 3.3pc on the same period last year, while revenue rose 27.2pc to £250m.

‘Big isn’t always beautiful’ says ex-minister amid pension reforms
High-quality small pension schemes should not be “driven out” in Government reform plans, a former pensions minister has said.
Sir Steve Webb, who was a minister in David Cameron’s coalition government, said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Ms Reeves’ plans to create “megafunds” will be an evolution in the current local government system.
“It is certainly true by international standards Britain’s pensions are pretty small and fragmented,” Sir Webb said, but added the Government should remember that “big isn’t always beautiful” when it comes to pensions.
Sir Steve said: “The worry is there are some very high-quality smaller pension schemes run by very good employers... which wouldn’t meet a size test.
“The Government has to remember that big isn’t always beautiful.
“What matters isn’t only size but quality, investment returns, quality of service and really high quality small schemes shouldn’t be driven out.”

Ben & Jerry’s claims it was silenced over Palestine
Ben & Jerry’s is suing its parent company Unilever in a row over support for Palestinian refugees.
The ice cream maker has accused Unilever of attempting to block Ben & Jerry’s from making public statements about the plight of refugees from the conflict in Gaza.
Ben & Jerry’s alleges that Unilever has breached the terms of a confidential settlement made in 2022. The lawsuit claims Unilever was required to “respect and acknowledge the Ben & Jerry’s independent board’s primary responsibility over Ben & Jerry’s social mission”.
It added: “Ben & Jerry’s has on four occasions attempted to publicly speak out in support of peace and human rights.
“Unilever has silenced each of these efforts.”

Mr Kipling maker’s profits sweetened by falling inflation
Mr Kipling maker Premier Foods has posted rises in revenue and profit rises, as easing inflation gives shoppers more confidence to indulge in treats.
Revenue grew by 4.6pc to £498.7m during the six months ending September, while profit was up by 5.5pc.
Chief executive Alex Whitehouse said sales from its brands, which includes Bisto, Loyd Grossman and Sharwood’s, were the “engine room” of its performance.
He said: “As inflation has begun to ease and shoppers are starting to feel more confident, we’ve seen consumers treat themselves more.”
He said the tax rises from the Budget were not “particularly significant” for the business, which employs more than 4,000 people, since it is “quite automated”.
Shares were down marginally by 0.1pc.

World oil demand to fall short of supplies next year, says IEA
World oil demand will grow at a slower pace next year amid waning demand from China, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said.
The world’s demand for oil will fall short of supply by more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) next year even if Opec+ cuts remain in place, the Paris-based agency said in its monthly oil market report.
The IEA left its 2025 oil demand growth forecast little-changed on the month, expecting oil demand to rise by 990,000 bpd next year.
The IEA saw China’s third-quarter consumption 270,000 bpd below the same period for 2023 after six-straight months of contractions up to September.
The IEA also made a slight upward adjustment to its 2024 oil demand growth forecast, up by 60,000 bpd on the month to 920,000 bpd, on higher-than-expected gasoil demand in OECD countries in the third quarter.
The price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, was last down 0.3pc to nearly $72 a barrel, having dropped 6.5pc so far this year.

It announced an operating loss of £53m in the first half of its financial the year, down from a profit of £223m in the same period in 2023, as the luxury fashion sector navigates weak demand, particularly in China.

Drivers aren’t ready to go electric, says Europcar chief
Drivers do not want electric cars because of fears over charging infrastructure, the British boss of a European car rental giant has warned.
Gary Smith, the UK managing director of Europcar, said leisure customers from airports do not want to drive electric vehicles.
He said the Government would need to “incentivise people to make that switch” but warned Britain’s  charging infrastructure “is just not large enough to be able to cope” with a transition away from petrol and diesel emission cars.
When he was prime minister, Rishi Sunak delayed the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030 to 2035 to give industry more time to catch up.
Mr Smith told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re split between corporate activity and commercial and leisure activity and the leisure market is really not ready for electric vehicles.
“There are a lot of people who will come into the country from one of our airport locations and they won’t be familiar with the road and where they are travelling to.
“They certainly won’t be familiar with the charging infrastructure.
“That really does give us a challenge because our leisure customers are telling us that they don’t want to rent electric vehicles right now.
“The country isn’t quite ready.”

Airlines face fines from regulator after air traffic control chaos
Airline passengers will benefit from tougher enforcement of consumer protection laws following an inquiry into the August 2023 air traffic control (ATC) meltdown, Transport Secretary Louise Haigh has said.
The Cabinet minister said she wants to ensure “all passengers feel confident when they fly”.
More than 700,000 passengers suffered disruption when flights were grounded at UK airports on August 28 last year after ATC provider National Air Traffic Services (Nats) suffered a technical glitch while processing a flight plan.
An investigation into what happened found a number of travellers waited “many weeks, and in some cases months” for airlines to refund their out-of-pocket expenses.
It recommended that regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is given the power to “take consumer enforcement action” without going through the courts.
This could include the ability to issue fines, which would bring it into line with regulators in some other sectors.

Ms Reeves is expected to use her first Mansion House speech this evening to announce plans to consolidate defined contribution (DC) schemes and pool assets from 86 local government pension scheme authorities in a new Pension Schemes Bill next year.
Ms Blackwell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We think it’s a really important step in the right direction. It really mirrors what has already happened in the defined benefit private sector world.
“We can use our economies of scale and expertise to invest in complex projects in the UK.
“It doesn’t solve all the issues but it is very much a step in the right direction.”

WH Smith travel shops drive profits higher
Retailer WH Smith has recorded a 16pc hike in annual profits as its travel arm continued to drive sales higher.
The group reported underlying pre-tax profits of £166m for the year to August 31, up from £143m the previous year.
Trading profits jumped by 15pc to £189m at its shops based in railway stations, airports and hospitals worldwide, with these outlets in the UK seeing earnings leap by a fifth.
Earnings remained flat at its traditional high street arm, at £32m, despite a 2pc drop in like-for-like sales.
Chief executive Carl Cowling said: “The group has delivered an excellent performance throughout the year, particularly over the key summer trading period.”
“While there is some economic uncertainty, we are confident that 2025 will be another year of good progress for the group.”

Global cryptocurrency worth more than $3 trillion
The value of the global cryptocurrency market has topped $3 trillion after the election of Donald Trump raised hopes that friendlier US regulation could usher in a new boom for the digital assets.
The sum market value of cryptocurrencies touched a high of nearly $3.2 trillion in the early hours of today, according to analytics and data aggregator CoinGecko.
That puts it above even the heady days of 2021, when pandemic-era stimulus pumped up speculative investments, and marks a stunning revival from just a few months ago when crypto prices and turnover had been flatlining and the outlook was humdrum.
Bitcoin dominates the market and the market value milestone coincided with the token’s rise to a record $93,480 .
Mr Trump’s election, and that of several pro-crypto candidates to Congress, has driven the wave of euphoria by apparently clearing some of the uncertainty around US regulations.
Bitcoin has doubled this year and is up 30pc since Election Day. Smaller cryptocurrency ether is up about 33pc since the election to $3,220.
Dogecoin, an alternative and volatile token promoted by billionaire Trump-ally Elon Musk, has gained 140pc.

Burberry announces £40m cost-cutting plan after swinging to loss
Burberry has announced plans to cut costs by £40m after swinging to a £53m loss in six months.
Joshua Schulman, who joined the fashion house in July as chief executive, said he wanted to focus on “productivity, simplification and financial discipline” in a bid to “stabilise the business”.
Burberry suspended its dividend for 2025 after it fell a loss in the six months to September after recording a £223m profit during the same period last year.
In its strategy update, Burberry signalled that its price increases had gone too far, saying prices, particularly in leather goods, “did not always align with our category authority”.
Mr Schulman said his turnaround plan would involve improving its website and in-store productivity, shaking up pricing and focusing more on the company’s core products.
He said: “Our recent underperformance has stemmed from several factors, including inconsistent brand execution and a lack of focus on our core outerwear category and our core customer segments.”
He added: “Today, we are acting with urgency to course correct, stabilise the business and position Burberry for a return to sustainable, profitable growth.”

Gas prices surge to highest point this year after Russia supply warning
Gas prices surged to their highest level in a year after one of Europe’s key energy companies warned that supplies from Russia could be hit by a legal row.
Dutch front-month futures - the benchmark contract used in Europe - rose as much as 5.4pc after the intervention by Austrian energy group OMV.
Gas prices breached €46 per megawatt hour for the first time since November last year after the company received an award of €230m (£191m) from an arbitration council this week relating to Russian oil and gas supplier Gazprom.
It follows a legal row over “irregular” gas supplies to OMV from Gazprom in 2022.
OMV said it will immediately seek to recover the settlement by off-setting claims against invoices from the Kremlin-backed supplier.
It warned that this may hurt contractual relations with Gazprom and potentially lead to a halt of supplies.
Europe has become susceptible to swings in supply levels on the global gas market after pipeline supplies were largely switched off by Russia following Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.
07:31 AM GMT
Good morning
Thanks for joining me. We begin the day with a look at Europe’s energy market, where the cost of gas has hit the highest point this year.
Austrian energy group OMV has been awarded €230m (£191m) after a legal dispute with Russian supplier Gazprom.
It said its efforts to recover the amount quickly could impact supplies from the Kremlin-backed group.

20241115,META,"To the window, to the wall… Mark Zuckerberg found a new call(ing): to become a singer. The Meta CEO released his own version of Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz hit 2002 single “Get Low” on Wednesday in commemoration of the night he met his wife.
Zuckerberg—the third-richest man in the world worth $205 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index—joined forces with rapper T-Pain for his own rendition of the “lyrical masterpiece,” as he calls it, in his Instagram post announcing the song’s release.
“‘Get Low’ was playing when I first met Priscilla at a college party, so every year we listen to it on our dating anniversary,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post on Instagram, which is owned by Meta. “This year I worked with @tpain on our own version of this lyrical masterpiece. Sound on for the track and also available on Spotify. Love you P ❤️”
“It’s so romantic,” Chan said while giggling in an Instagram Stories video responding to the song. “21 years later I can’t get quite as low, but it brings back a lot of fond memories.”
Zuckerberg, a.k.a. “Z-Pain,” and T-Pain took an acoustic, slower approach to the cover—although most of the explicit lyrics remain. The accompanying Spotify music video short shows T-Pain and Zuckerberg sitting in what appears to be a small music studio with Zuckerberg playing a guitar. The unlikely pair also share a fist bump in the video. In order to watch the Spotify clip, you have to play the song on full screen on your phone.
“Mark and Priscilla are celebrating their 21st dating anniversary,” a Meta spokesperson told Fortune in a statement. “He continues to lower the bar when it comes to gifts for her.”
Representatives for T-Pain and Lil Jon didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment on the song.
“ Happy anniversary! Thanks for letting me be a part of this 🔥,” T-Pain commented on Zuckerberg’s Instagram post.
Zuckerberg and the early days of Facebook
While Zuckerberg famously didn’t finish his undergrad years at Harvard University, he did get two life-changing experiences out of it: meeting his wife, Priscilla Chan, and launching his social network Facebook.
Zuckerberg met Chan at an Alpha Epsilon Pi frat party in 2003, around the time “Get Low” was at the height of its popularity. This was also the same era in which Zuckerberg had launched “Facemash,” one of the early versions of Facebook, which ranked the attractiveness of Harvard students. When Chan first met Zuckerberg in a bathroom line at that party, she assumed Zuckerberg was getting kicked out for ideating the hot-or-not site.
Story Continues
“I’m going to get kicked out in three days, so we need to go on a date quickly,” Zuckerberg told Chan, as he recalled in his 2017 commencement address at Harvard. ""Without Facemash, I wouldn't have met Priscilla.”
Zuckerberg was so nonchalant about school at the time—and, evidently, so interested in Chan—he told her he’d rather take her out on a date than finish his take-home midterm exam.
“The type-A first child in me was appalled,"" Chan said in a 2014 interview with TODAY. ""Turns out he was just trying to convince me to spend more time with him...and I've since learned that he's very bright.""
While Zuckerberg wasn’t ultimately expelled from Harvard, he decided in 2004 to drop out in pursuit of building Facebook, which went public in 2012. Now, Meta—which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads—has a $1.46 trillion market cap, making it one of the largest tech companies in the world.
Despite having built a massive tech empire, Zuckerberg insists his relationship with Chan is even more important. Together, they have three children: Maxima, August, and Aurelia.
“She’s the most important person in my life, so you could say it was the most important thing I built in my time here,” Zuckerberg said in his Harvard speech.

20241115,META,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Will Go Higher in Trump Presidency. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer.
In a recent program, Jim Cramer celebrated the market’s rally on Donald Trump’s election victory, saying the market likes Trump.
“The market likes Donald J. Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?”
Cramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.
“Trump wants to cut taxes—all taxes—including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It’s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that’s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.”
Cramer said the market is still “oversold” as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground. However, Cramer said the polls were again proved wrong.
Cramer then talked about the stocks that investors can buy to ride the Trump rally.

Talking about Meta, Cramer said:
“I would also buy Meta here. There’s all sorts of bogus scuttlebutt  about how the President elect and Mark Zuckerberg don’t get along. I think that’s the old days people.  I believe things have gotten better between the two, and you should think more about the fundamentals now, which are fabulous. Look, there is some common ground between the two. People were worried about the two of them being angry at each other. No.”

Despite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg’s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).
According to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta’s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the world’s largest social network, were up this quarter, due to impressive top-line growth of 22% year-over-year and solid forward guidance. Despite its large scale, Meta continues to outgrow the broader digital advertising industry, with better AI-driven content recommendations increasing engagement in products like Instagram Reels, and AI improving ad targeting and conversion rates. Our industry checks have continued to validate advertiser adoption and satisfaction, with improvements in Reels monetization, as well as strong adoption of Advantage+, Meta’s AI-driven service to allocate advertiser budgets across its content surfaces.
Overall, META ranks 1st on our list of stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241115,META,"(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. was hit with a €798 million ($841 million) fine by European Union regulators by tying its Facebook Marketplace service to the social network, the US tech giant’s first ever penalty for EU antitrust violations.

In a groundbreaking decision, the European Commission ordered Meta to stop tying its classified-ads service to Facebook’s sprawling social media platform, and refrain from imposing unfair trading conditions on rival second-hand goods platforms.
“Meta tied its online classified ads service Facebook Marketplace to its personal social network Facebook and imposed unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers,” EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, said. “It did so to benefit its own service Facebook Marketplace.”
The move adds to a spate of bad news for Meta. A US judge ruled that the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against the company can continue to trial on Wednesday, while Donald Trump was elected US president again. His victory helped propel the social networking app Bluesky, which competes with Meta’s Threads, to the top of Apple Inc.’s US App Store.
Trump called Facebook an “enemy of the people” just eight months ago and suggested Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg should go to jail.
The EU fine is likely to be one of the final acts for Vestager, who’s set to leave her post before the end of the year. Over the past decade, she has been one of Silicon Valley’s toughest critics levying billions of euros in antitrust penalties, including over €8 billion in fines against Google.
The decision follows a probe into how Meta leverages Facebook’s billions of users to squeeze out rivals. EU watchdogs said Menlo Park California-based Meta also used data from rival platforms that advertised on Facebook to boost its Marketplace service.
Meta vowed to appeal the decision at the bloc’s courts, a process that could take several years. It said the penalty “ignores the realities of the thriving European market” and “shields large incumbent companies.”
Meta shares fell as much as 1% after trading opened in New York. The company was earlier fined €110 million by the EU merger regulator for providing misleading information about its takeover of messaging service WhatsApp in 2017.
Story Continues
Amazon.com Inc. dodged EU fines in a similar case in 2022, targeting how the US. ecommerce firm allegedly pillaged rivals’ sales data to unfairly favor it own products. Regulators accepted a number of proposals from Amazon, including a vow to stop using non-public data on independent sellers on its marketplace for its competing retail business.
Facebook’s Marketplace has also been targeted by other regulators. It settled a probe with the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority after agreeing to a slate of concessions.
Meta reported sales of $40.6 billion in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, a jump of 19% compared to a year earlier. In recent years, Meta has been working to balance huge outlays on technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality, while still trying to ensure that its core digital advertising business is still growing.
While the EU can levy fines of 10% of global sales, its penalties are usually much smaller and take into account severity of the allegations and the sub-markets involved.
That’s led to frustration among regulators and a clamor for tougher remedies, including more structural solutions. Like the US, the EU has been weighing a potential breakup of Alphabet Inc.’s Google to allay concerns over its adtech dominance.
The new Digital Markets Act bolsters traditional antitrust law by placing strict guardrails on Silicon Valley firms.
The European Commission has kick-started probes into Google and Meta to vet their compliance with the DMA, while Apple Inc. is soon likely to face the bloc’s first fine for failing to step into line with the rules. This week Meta pitched changes to the way it targets users with ads on Facebook and Instagram, in order to offset an escalation in the investigation.

20241115,META,"The European Commission has fined Meta 797.72 million Euros (£663 million) for what it says are breaches of EU competition law related to the social media giant’s classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace.
The Commission said by tying Marketplace to its Facebook social media platform, consumers on Facebook were regularly exposed to Marketplace whether or not they wanted to be, and this gave the site a “substantial distribution advantage” which over classified ad platforms could not match.
The ruling also said Meta had unilaterally imposed unfair trading conditions on other classified ads services providers who advertise on Meta’s platforms, including allowing Meta to use ad-related data generated by other advertisers for the benefit of Facebook Marketplace.
It orders Meta to bring the conduct to an end and refrain from repeating the infringement, in addition to the fine.
The Commission said that while market dominance was in itself not illegal under EU antitrust rules, dominant companies have a special responsibility not to abuse their powerful market position by restricting competition.
Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president of the Commission in charge of competition policy, said: “Today we fine Meta 797.72 million euros for abusing its dominant positions in the markets for personal social network services and for online display advertising on social media platforms.
“Meta tied its online classified ads service Facebook Marketplace to its personal social network Facebook and imposed unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers.
“It did so to benefit its own service Facebook Marketplace, thereby giving it advantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.
“Meta must now stop this behaviour.”
In response, Meta said it would appeal the decision but would comply with the Commission’s ruling “in the meantime” and would “work quickly and constructively to launch a solution which addresses the points raised”, adding that it would “make announcements shortly to reassure our European users that Facebook Marketplace is here to stay”.
In a lengthy statement on the ruling, the US tech giant said: “Today, the European Commission announced a decision claiming that Facebook Marketplace has hindered competition for online marketplaces in Europe.
“This decision ignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services and shields large incumbent companies from a new entrant, Facebook Marketplace, that meets consumer demand in innovative and convenient new ways.
Story continues
“We will appeal this decision to ensure that consumers are well served in the EU.”
The firm argued that by creating Marketplace in 2016 and allowing users to buy and sell items for no charge, it had given consumers “a new choice beyond the large incumbent online marketplaces that have dominated the landscape”, and disputed the Commission’s claim that tying Marketplace to Facebook was an illegal link.
“The European Commission’s decision claims that Meta imposes Facebook Marketplace on people who use Facebook in an illegal ‘tie’.
“But that argument ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose whether or not to engage with Marketplace, and many don’t. The reality is that people use Facebook Marketplace because they want to, not because they have to,” Meta said.
“While the European Commission could not find any evidence of harm to competitors, they claim the entry and expansion of Facebook Marketplace has the potential to hinder the growth of large incumbent online marketplaces in the EU instead.
“But those very marketplaces are actually continuing to grow and dominate in the EU. Platforms like eBay, Leboncoin in France, Marktplaats in the Netherlands, Subito in Italy, Blocket in Sweden and Finn.no in Norway are formidable competitors and the market leader in many member states.
“They have continued to report considerable commercial success, including strong financial results and growth, since Facebook Marketplace launched. Successful new entrants — such as Vinted — have also emerged and continue to grow and thrive in Europe.”
It added: “EU competition law is intended to protect the competitive process and consumers, not to preserve the established business positions of incumbent providers in the face of innovation.
“Ironically, in the name of competition, this decision does just that at huge cost to consumers.”",0.30376751049192263,"[[ 0.14686584 -0.36392128 -0.45147267 ... -0.6795218  -0.66689074

Sovereign AI: a new concept gaining traction in the realm of artificial intelligence. As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing “sovereign” artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to “codify” a country’s culture, history, and collective intelligence.

That said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent’s competitiveness and technological resilience.
Filippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they “understand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.”
“As this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.”
While AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.
Latest Advancements in AI
In recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon’s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe’s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world’s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.
“WoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification”.

Other fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.
In other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed “Operator”, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel.

20241115,AAPL,"How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed higher on Thursday despite an overall decline in the stock market.
Consumer group Which? has filed a £3 billion ($3.81 billion) legal claim against Apple, accusing the tech giant of breaching UK competition law through its iCloud service.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) reduced stake in Apple from 400 million to 300 million shares. Thus, Berkshire has now cut its position in the Cupertino, California-based tech giant by over two-thirds since 2023's third quarter.
With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.44%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).
So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?
To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,369,320 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $273,864 or around 1,200 shares.
To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).
Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.
How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.
For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).
Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.
AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 1.4% to close at $228.22 on Thursday.

It’s no secret that all eyes are on the incoming Trump administration and what it might mean for every aspect of living, including markets and the economy.
One term likely to take center stage in the coming weeks as Trump builds out his Cabinet is the reemergence of tariffs and the larger implication on trade and the economy.
“We think and anticipate tariffs will be implemented,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, to Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below).
Luzzetti said tariffs will negatively impact economic growth.
Tariffs were a significant measure during the first Trump administration.
Trump imposed more than $300 billion in duties on Chinese goods. President Joe Biden largely re-upped Trump's policy in May — and added new tariffs on certain sectors on top.
Biden exclusively told Sozzi at the time the fresh tariffs were about ""being fair.""
Looking ahead to the new administration, one proposed move involves a baseline tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports with an eye toward bolstering US manufacturing. Trump has also floated stiffer tariffs on China, and new ones on Mexico.
“The jury’s out. We know the short run effects [from tariffs] so far from 2019, which is that it improved the trade balance with China, but didn’t necessarily improve the trade balance more broadly,” Luzzetti said.
The great economic unknown on tariffs was echoed by top leaders such as Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan at this week's Yahoo Finance Invest conference.

Trump’s bitcoin superpower promise may help Nvidia: Tech investor
Luzzetti ultimately views the data from Trump's first term as useful when forecasting what could be in the cards this time around.
The tariffs of 2019 focused heavily on China alongside materials like steel and aluminum. Luzzetti notes that what the economy of 2019 experienced “was some uplift in inflation.""
“[The] economy did come under pressure as a result of the tariffs,” he said. “Now, it sparked a trade war. Financial markets took it very negatively.”
China experienced a devaluation in its currency and in turn, global market sell-offs ensued.
“But you can actually see the manufacturing sector, industrial production had picked up in 2018 and then it was down negative in 2019,” Luzzetti pointed out. “We have clear evidence that tariffs do work as we expect, which is a negative supply shock for the economy in the short term.”

""We have learned [there] cannot just be tariffs on one particular country, because it is unlikely that [it] reorients that production, say, out of China into the US,” Luzzetti warns. “There’s a lot of other stopping places that you get to before that.”

The projected fair value for Apple is US$245 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
With US$228 share price, Apple appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value
Analyst price target for AAPL is US$244 which is similar to our fair value estimate
How far off is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.
View our latest analysis for Apple
Is Apple Fairly Valued?
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t
Story Continues
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$234b× (1 + 2.6%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.6%) = US$5.0t
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.0t÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$2.5t
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.7t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$228, the company appears about fair value at a 6.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow November 15th 2024
The Assumptions
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.158. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
SWOT Analysis for Apple
Strength
Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.
Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.
Threat
Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.
Moving On:
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation.

20241115,AAPL,"(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech stocks have had a relatively muted reaction to Donald Trump’s election victory, as investors parse how his second term might play out. So far, many are reserving judgment.

There’s a multitude of new risks to consider. Tariffs on products from China and elsewhere could lead to a resurgence of inflation or disrupt supply chains for the likes of Apple Inc., while anti-immigration policies could potentially disrupt companies that use skilled worker visas. Trump’s personal dislike of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. is also something investors in those stocks are worried about.
But there’s also a possible benefit for tech giants in a friendlier regulatory climate — especially those currently under antitrust pressure. Much has also been made of a potential artificial intelligence push by the new administration, which could have ripple effects through the tech sector. Top of mind for all, though, is the unpredictability of the President-elect — and how much of his campaign rhetoric will actually make it into policy.
These cross-currents have left most of the Magnificent 7 in a less-than euphoric mood. With the exception of Tesla Inc., which has surged more than 20% due to Elon Musk’s vocal support for Trump, none of the group has participated in a big way in the post-election stock market rally. Apple is up just over 2%, while Facebook parent Meta is up less than 1%. Amazon.com Inc. has fared better, gaining 6%. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 3.3%.
As the dust settles after the election result, we asked Big Tech investors what they’re thinking about. Here’s what they’re saying:
Tiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle:
“Tariffs are the biggest risk for parts of tech. Tariffs on imports from China can certainly impact prices for a number of products including consumer electronics and also some enterprise components like servers that are often manufactured in China. And then higher prices could potentially depress demand for those products.
We have seen some pressure on Meta and Alphabet since the election. I think part of that is concern about the rhetoric that he has made regarding those companies.”
Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott

“The market is looking at things through rose-colored glasses. It seems to be ignoring trade and tariffs. Some of this depends on what the priorities are. If the focus is on tax policy and deregulation, that will sort of act as a down payment of the move we’ve seen, and it could provide another boost to stocks. If Trump focuses on deportation and tariffs, that will become problematic for stocks.
I don’t think the market will swoon, or that there will be an a-ha moment, but if tariffs are a priority, we could experience a period of weakness as people adjust to that.”
Mark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr Marbach & Co.
“The regulatory backdrop is clearly going to get better. The Trump administration has indicated that one of its key focuses will be in reducing regulation, which should be pretty much across-the-board positive for the market and the economy. I think Khan being gone from the FTC would be a huge plus. I think she’s pretty extreme, which gave everyone anxiety. That will be a plus for next year.”
Threats against Alphabet and Meta are “just talk at this point. He felt these internet companies had their thumbs on the scales against him, and he doesn’t take kindly to that. However, I don’t think anything like this will make it into policy.”
Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management
“Trump says a lot of stuff and he can be very contradictory. Words are one thing, actions are another. The dual edged sword on Google and Meta is that he doesn’t like them. They have platforms that he thinks didn’t put him the best light.
The thing that’s contra to that is that he wants to back off on the regulatory side. That’s a counter perspective to that. We’ll see.”
Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management
“I don’t know how much universal tariffs remain a policy priority. There are still a lot of question marks. It would be a problem for semis, and for parts of the computer sector. But it wouldn’t necessarily sink the tech sector overall. There will still be demand. People aren’t going to give up their iPhones, though they will cost more.
I don’t think software faces much risk from tariffs, and the impact on hardware is to be determined. I have exposure to Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple. I don’t know how tariffs will impact Nvidia, since the demand will remain there no matter what. Broadcom goes kind of hand in hand with that. I think that at Apple, Cook will take steps to keep the products from exploding in price.”
Adam Grossman, chief investment officer of global equity at Riverfront Investment Group:
“It’s still unclear a week after the election. I do think he could get tariffs through on China, but getting tariffs through on Europe, that’s another ball of wax.
For someone like Donald Trump, I think he’s going to have enough other issues that they’re going to kind of fly off of his radar.”

20241115,AAPL,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that you must read today.
Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ to discuss the market’s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we’ve had some ""very good"" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.
READ ALSO: 10 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and 15 AI News That Broke The Internet
Hickey’s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.
Developments in the AI Landscape
With AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn’t anyone who doesn’t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the “Future 40”. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.
Artificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure”, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China’s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act “as ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.”
Story Continues
As per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden’s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments “to give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure”, amongst other things.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational corporation and technology company. This AI player has been heavily investing in artificial intelligence technology. Recently, it revealed its personal artificial intelligence system, Apple Intelligence, across many of its devices.
On November 13, Evercore ISI reiterated Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as “Outperform” with a price target of $250. The analysts deem it as one of their top picks heading into 2025, affirming that the tech giant is set to benefit from artificial intelligence in the long term.
“The impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales remains highly debated and while it is unlikely we will see a super cycle this year, we do not think this should be overly concerning for investors”.
As more AI features get incorporated, iPhone growth is also ticking higher, analysts note. Moreover, they state that the company’s AI strategy isn’t just limited to iPhones, rather, the company also possesses the ability to monetize third-party AI efforts. This ability will enable them to reap the AI rewards without the massive uptick in CapEx witnessed by their mega-cap peers, they penned.
Overall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241115,AAPL,"(Bloomberg) — The alarm from economists has been clear for months: Brace yourself. If he delivers on his campaign promises for an aggressive package of new US tariffs, they’ve warned, a re-elected Donald Trump will set the stage for a historic period of turmoil in the global economy.

The Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions
And yet there’s a reason CEOs, bankers, investors and even Trump advisers have largely shrugged off warnings about the damage a 10%-to-20% universal tariff and even higher import duties on China would do, or the resurgence in US inflation they might bring.
From the incoming president’s own track record, many see evidence Trump is unlikely to deliver on all he has threatened, and express confidence they can adapt to whatever he delivers this time around.
Even as economists decried his plans as a terrible miscalculation, Trump ratcheted up protectionist threats on the campaign trail because they were a key part of an agenda popular with voters. After his win, he claimed a license to deliver on those promises.
“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” Trump told supporters. “Success is going to bring us together, and we are going to start by all putting America first.”
His former trade czar, Robert Lighthizer, who is expected to have a prominent post in a new administration, has warned that the rest of the world should be ready for new US tariffs and that any country with a trade surplus should be willing to address Trump’s grievances.
“Countries that run consistently large surpluses are the protectionists in the global economy,” Lighthizer wrote in the Financial Times last week. “We would be merely responding to the harm they have caused.”
But hanging over those threats are big questions: Is Trump bluffing, and even if he isn’t, how will the world respond? His first term in office was renowned for chaotic economic policymaking and bitter internal battles between rival aides on trade.
Trump also built a reputation as a transactional president, who was open to lobbying from CEOs like Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) Tim Cook on tariffs and flattery from foreign counterparts who learned trade threats could be defused with a promise to buy more Iowa soybeans, or even a peck on the cheek.
The world has also changed. Companies have worked hard on adapting to tariffs — avoiding them where possible and realigning supply chains. These are core skills now, honed through the chaos of the COVID pandemic and the advent of an era in which geopolitics drives trade and investment more than the sole pursuit of cost efficiencies.
Story Continues
In earnings calls Wednesday, executives at automakers including BMW (BMW.DE) and Honda Motor Co. (HMC, 7267.T) signaled they were prepared to weather any Trump tariff storm, thanks in large part to the large manufacturing operations they have already in the US.
“There is some natural cover-up against possible tariffs or whatever, but let’s not speculate whether there are tariffs. It might also only be that this is a verbal issue,” Oliver Zipse, BMW’s CEO and chairman, told analysts, pointing to growing sales in the US where it already manufactures cars. “In the United States, I would think we almost have a perfect setup for the time to come.”
Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK) CEO Donald Allan Jr. told analysts recently the company had been planning for a Trump victory and a new tariff regime since the spring. The plan calls for price increases on its machine tools to offset any new duties and shifting production out of China to other Asian countries or Mexico as necessary.
“We have a playbook on the shelf ready to go,” Allan said. But that doesn’t include doing what Trump wants companies to do. It’s “unlikely that we’re moving a lot back to the US because it’s just not cost effective to do,” Allan said.
Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM), the home-furnishing chain, is ready for changes, too. Back in 2018, half of the San Francisco-based retailer’s imports came from China. Now, that reliance is 25%, Jeff Howie explained to analysts recently. “If this does come up and tariffs are expanded, we’re prepared to reduce it further.”
Such planning reflects an acknowledgment of a new business reality. But it also illustrates a growing acceptance among both policymakers and executives that tariffs can be a useful tool for governments facing international competition.
Everett Eissenstat, who served as Trump’s representative to the Group of Seven and G-20 in his first administration and is now a partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs, said there was little to stop Trump from carrying out his tariff threats.
“This is really a huge shift,” he said. “I think we’re entering into a period of a recalibration of the global trading system.”
Even true believers in protectionism admit broad tariffs have some negative side effects. Trump’s victory sent the dollar (DX=F) sharply higher against Chinese, European and emerging market currencies. That raises the specter of not only less competitive US exports, but also potential economic turmoil outside the US that would reduce demand.
Trump’s stated goal for his trade strategy has always been to export more and import less. It’s why he sees the US’s persistent trade deficits as a profit-and-loss statement deeply in the red. A strong dollar that leads to US companies selling less overseas might anger Trump and only cause him to double down on protectionism.
Still, senior bankers say privately that companies and policymakers around the world are confident they learned how to deal with Trump and his trade wars during his first term.
Some of that has been fueled by other Trump advisers who quietly have been circulating on Wall Street and beyond for months, insisting that the now-incoming president’s tariff threats will be used as negotiating leverage against countries including China — not to spark all-out trade warfare.
The economic risk, of course, is that this is America’s frog-enjoying-the-warm-water-before-it-boils moment, where inflationary worries are ignored. One senior banker recently expressed concern that the clients he met with on his travels were in fact too sanguine about the turmoil ahead.
Aside From Tariffs
Tariffs aren’t the only ways Trump can upend global trade.
The next few years will likely bring a renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement — the rebranded North American Free Trade Agreement that was a signature trade achievement of his first term.
Trump has signaled anger at Chinese investments in Mexican factories to produce electric vehicles and other products and avoid his original tariffs. He’s also linked immigration to tariffs by threatening harsh levies on imports from Mexico, if the new government there doesn’t block migrants from crossing to the US.
Delivering on much of what Trump promised on the campaign trail may depend on who controls Congress. That’s not necessarily the case with trade policy, in which US presidents have expansive authority to act unilaterally, particularly if national security can be invoked.
Any restraint will have to come from within a new administration, from financial markets or from domestic constituencies hurt by US tariffs or their inevitable flipside: retaliation.
‘Super Genius’
Elon Musk’s investments in both China, via Tesla (TSLA), and Trump’s campaign could wield more influence on what the new president chooses to do than the hawks in his national security team. “He’s a super genius,” Trump told supporters on Wednesday. “We have to protect our super geniuses.”
Though Trump repeatedly shrugged off economists’ warnings about his tariffs, the scale of the potential impact may also eventually end up giving him and his advisers pause.
According to calculations by economists Maeva Cousin and Eleonora Mavroeidi of Bloomberg Economics, raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% and those from all other countries to 20% would lead to a bigger shock than even the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 delivered.
That legislation, widely credited with setting off trade wars that deepened the Great Depression globally, saw average US tariff rates go from 14% to close to 20%. Trump’s proposals would send the average from 3% currently to more than 20%, a far steeper jump.
Combined with retaliation from China and other countries, by the 2028 election the tariffs would lead to US economic output being 1.3% lower than otherwise, the Bloomberg Economics pair calculated.
Given the scope of the potential fallout, Anna Wong, Bloomberg Economics’ chief US economist, says the most plausible scenario is that while Trump will increase some bilateral tariffs, he won’t impose universal tariffs.
“We think procedural requirements, as well as the response from the economy, will limit the scope of trade actions,” Wong wrote in a research note this week. “We also assume US trade partners would retaliate in kind.”
In a recent report, Goldman Sachs economists said the most likely scenario would feature higher duties on imports from China, delivered quickly. The top rates would likely be reserved for strategic products, with consumer goods facing lower levies. That would lead to an average tariff hike on China of around 20 percentage points, they calculated — a level lower than the 60% Trump has threatened.
Trust Issue
There are those who also worry about a broader erosion in global trust in the US, even if Trump is slow to deploy his economic weapons.
Emily Blanchard, who until last year served as chief economist at the US State Department and is now at Dartmouth College, said there is little doubt that a second Trump term will bring a further deterioration in the US standing in the world and its economic alliances.
“If the US takes actions demonstrating that we’re no longer committed to openness and fairness, rules and transparency and predictability, then the whole game changes,” Blanchard said. “Firms, investors and governments are going to try to protect themselves and build out contingency plans.”
For those who believe that they can adapt to another Trump term or even charm their way through a trade standoff, there are examples to follow. Musk’s rise in Trump’s inner circle, for one, has proved that a politician once full of vitriol for electric cars can be won over by a man who made his fortune selling them.
Cook’s Approach
Then there was Apple’s Cook, who managed to avoid most of the company’s China-assembled products from being subjected to Trump’s tariffs in August 2019 by flying in to dine with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Cook’s argument was simple: How could Apple compete against South Korean rival Samsung if the government was going to make his products more expensive?
“I thought he made a very compelling argument,” Trump told reporters the next day. Most of Apple’s products have avoided the 25% tariffs that other imports have faced.

Some national leaders similarly courted Trump, and seem to be preparing to do the same in a second term. Mindful of the risk their trade surplus with the US presents, South Korean officials have for months been drafting a plan to boost energy imports from the US if Trump is elected, Bloomberg reported this week.
European officials now girding themselves for a new rise in transatlantic tensions have their own examples to draw on.
In July 2018, facing a potentially devastating Trump threat of tariffs on European cars, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was then president of the European Commission, flew to Washington to try to work out a deal.
The night before a scheduled Oval Office meeting, two senior aides to the respective presidents hashed out a compromise under which the EU would buy American soybeans and natural gas. But whether Trump would embrace the deal was unclear, people close to the talks said.
Until the next day: Juncker marched into Trump’s office for the meeting and planted a healthy kiss on Trump as a greeting that not only charmed Trump but caused him to order up a Rose Garden press conference to quickly unveil the unfinished deal.
“Obviously the European Union,” as represented by Juncker, “and the United States, as represented by yours truly, love each other!” Trump later tweeted, attaching a photo of the kiss.

20241115,AAPL,"Apple (AAPL, Financials) has introduced a covert security feature in its iOS 18.1 update that triggers iPhones to reboot automatically after 72 hours of inactivity, a measure aimed at enhancing data protection.
Dubbed ""inactivity reboot,"" the function was first revealed by404 Media and has been seen by law enforcement and forensic professionals who noticed that seized iPhones restarted, therefore complicating attempts at information extraction.
The ""inactivity reboot"" locks encryption keys inside the Secure Enclave Processor of iPhones in a ""Before First Unlock"" state. Even if the gadget is left turned on for long periods, this security feature inhibits illegal access to it.
Apple's iOS 18.2 update now lets customers turn on the Stolen Device Protection capability right during setup. Originally only found in the Settings menu, this option limits data access via a PIN, hence strengthening anti-theft security.
Apart from these security improvements, Apple Intelligence, its new AI platform, is helping Apple to be more visible in the smart home market by including artificial intelligence. Aiming to provide more context-aware smart home solutions, next items include Apple-branded home security cameras and a six-inch wall-mounted screen hub.
Underlining Apple's potential in artificial intelligence and predicted slow iPhone growth, Evercore ISI analystsled by Amit Daryananihave found Apple as a top stock selection going into 2025.
On the other hand, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel made a pessimistic call, downgrading Apple to underweight with a $200 target and voicing worries about the effects of low-cost iPhone SE updates and high valuation levels.

20241115,AMZN,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) are major players in the chipmaking and artificial intelligence (AI) segment but have seen varying degrees of success over the past two years — none have experienced Nvidia’s (NVDA) groundbreaking success. Personally, I’m bearish on Intel and TSMC, but I’m bullish on AMD, expecting it to experience continued market share gains and share price appreciation over the medium term.
While AMD is unlikely to reach the heights we’ve seen at Nvidia, the stock could see further supportive trends over the next three to five years. Meanwhile, I’m put off TSMC by its geographical concentration risk and Intel represents too big a risk after years of technological underinvestment.
AMD: The Next Big Winner?
Let’s start with AMD. The stock has surged over the past two years, but nowhere near as much as Nvidia. However, it’s arguably Nvidia’s biggest competitor in terms of technological capabilities in the fast-growing data center and AI segment. The company is also making significant strides in developing its “full-stack” offering — software to complement the hardware — which could substantially enhance its competitiveness in the AI market.
AMD’s recent acquisition of ZT Systems marks an important step in this full-stack direction, representing its first major foray into comprehensive AI software solutions. This strategic move is expected to improve system-level integration, reduce time-to-market for AI solutions, and expand AMD’s reach into the hyperscale market.
And there’s plenty of market to grow into. That’s because AMD currently holds less than 5% of the GPU market share for AI and around 11% of the overall AI market share (including CPUs). AMD is positioning itself for growth and claims that its EPYC processors and Instinct accelerators offer superior performance for AI inferencing workloads, particularly in data centers.
AMD’s Valuation
The problem with AMD is that some fairly considerable growth expectations are already priced in. The stock is currently trading at 44.4x forward earnings and has a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.08. So, while the company is expected to grow earnings by around 40% annually over the medium term, there’s clearly some downside risk because of the sizeable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Still, I’m bullish on AMD.
I’m expecting earnings to surge over the coming years as hyperscalers seek Nvidia alternatives as part of a broader effort to de-risk and expand the supply chain. I understand that the stock is pricey, but I really don’t see these AI-related tailwinds slowing down for AMD.
Story Continues
On TipRanks, AMD comes in as a Strong Buy based on 26 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by Wall Street analysts in the past three months. The average AMD stock price target is $187.04, implying a more than 34.3% upside potential.
See more AMD analyst ratings
Intel: It’s Losing Out
Intel has largely missed out on the initial AI boom that has propelled competitors like Nvidia and AMD to new heights in 2024. Nvidia has dominated the market for AI accelerators, and AMD has made significant inroads, but Intel has struggled to gain traction with its AI offerings.
However, while Intel’s chip business may have been falling behind for almost a decade now, Intel may be poised for a recovery in 2025 as it ramps up its AI strategy. The company has been investing heavily in developing new AI-focused products and technologies, as Intel’s upcoming Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake processors are slated for release in late 2024 and early 2025. Both are designed to better support AI workloads on PCs and servers.
The company is targeting over 100 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2025, which could help it regain market share. Additionally, Intel’s partnership with Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS to build custom AI Fabric Chips and Xeon 6 processors represents a major opportunity in the data center and cloud AI market. It’s a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar deal and could significantly boost Intel’s AI credentials.
Intel Might Not Surge Back
However, Intel’s foundry services present both challenges and opportunities. The foundries are currently being consolidated into an independent subsidiary and may play a crucial role in the company’s AI strategy or could be sold — although a buyer might be hard to find.
By attracting more third-party customers for chip manufacturing, Intel could position itself as a key player in the AI hardware ecosystem. However, many of Intel’s production nodes use the company’s proprietary electronic design automation (EDA) tools and flows and are designed for Intel CPUs. That may be something that needs addressing if Intel is to service the wider market more regularly.
On TipRanks, INTC comes in as a Hold based on one Buys, 22 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average INTC stock price target is $24.43, implying about 2% downside potential. Personally, and as someone who broadly avoids trying to catch falling knives, I’m bearish on Intel. Of course, a recovery may be in the cards, but it’s not a risk I’d wish to take as an investor.
See more INTC analyst ratings
TSMC: A Winner with Concentration Risk
Interestingly, TSMC has said it won’t be looking to buy Intel’s foundry business despite being one of the few companies in the world with the financial capacity to do so. I say ‘interestingly’ because Intel’s foundries are located all around the world, including in places like Ireland and Israel. Meanwhile, TSMC’s foundries are located predominantly in Taiwan — an island nation claimed by Beijing — creating a degree of concentration risk.
Of course, there are a host of reasons why TSMC wouldn’t buy Intel’s foundries, including the fact that Intel’s nodes will be different from those of the Taiwanese company — as noted above. Moreover, TSMC has its own expansion strategy, which includes notable projects in the United States, Japan, and Europe.
More generally, the company is already well-positioned to benefit from increasing demand for advanced chips in AI, 5G, and high-performance computing applications. TSMC’s continued investment in cutting-edge process technologies should help maintain its competitive edge while benefiting from other companies’ success as a major supplier to firms like Nvidia.
TSMC’s Discount Is Not Enough
However, geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan pose a risk to TSMC’s operations, resulting in the stock typically trading at a discount to peers. TSMC currently trades at 27.2x forward earnings, representing a 6.9% premium to the information technology sector as a whole. However, the PEG ratio indicates that, on face value, this stock is undervalued with a ratio of 0.8.
On TipRanks, TSM comes in as a Strong Buy based on five Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average TSM stock price target is $205, implying about 9.8% upside potential.
See more TSM analyst ratings
Personally, given the existential and geopolitical risks facing Taiwan and TSMC’s operations base, I’m turning bearish on the stock. It’s gone too high for the geopolitical risk in my opinion. I realize that this is a change of tune for me, but at nearly $200 a share, it’s not a risk I’m willing to take.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A showdown between former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and social media influencer-turned-fighter Jake Paul on Friday is the latest one-two punch from Netflix, as the media giant hopes to cash in on sports' sprint to streaming.
The intergenerational showdown has all the makings of a crossover hit, with 58-year-old Tyson bringing in the old guard and 27-year-old Paul, who achieved early fame on YouTube, appealing to the younger, screen-toting social media junkies.
Available to all of Netflix's more than 280 million subscribers for no additional fee, it could be a welcome change for American boxing fans accustomed to shelling out extra to watch marquee matches on long-time broadcaster HBO.
""The trend in all sports right now is moving some of their properties to streaming,"" said Bob Dorfman, a veteran San Francisco-based sports marketing analyst.
""This is two huge personalities - it does have the potential to be the biggest streaming sports event.""
The American subscription television network HBO announced in 2018 it was dropping live boxing from its programming, ending a 45-year relationship with the sport and leaving a broadcasting vacuum in its wake.
Netflix has dabbled in sports content before, with exhibition golf and tennis events and the wildly popular docuseries ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"" which is credited with boosting the auto racing circuit's popularity in the U.S.
The fight at the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, its first live boxing event, works in favor of Netflix's strategy of providing proprietary content that viewers cannot find elsewhere.
While the fight will not have traditional advertising, it has sponsors whose messages will be part of the live streamed event.
Advertising is not a major contributor to the streamer's current revenue, though its ad-supported tier is quickly growing, with 70 million subscribers reported this week, up from 40 million in May.
The mega-event is the sign of a lasting love affair between sport and streaming, said Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports, though he predicts streaming and traditional broadcast will exist side-by-side for the foreseeable future.
""This is a one-time-only event... It's more as a novelty in my view. It doesn't change the industry,"" said Pilson, president of Pilson Communications.
""The industry is still going to be driven by the league deals (like) MLS, NFL, Major League Baseball.""
Amazon Prime picked up Thursday Night Football in 2021 and MLS signed a 10-year mega-deal with Apple TV in 2022 worth a reported $2.5 billion.
Story Continues
Major League Baseball signed a deal with Apple for ""Friday Night Baseball,"" a weekly doubleheader, in 2022, as well.
Leagues have been gravitating to streaming both because it reaches a global audience, including younger viewers, who are not watching traditional television.
MLS Commissioner Don Garber said the Apple streaming platform allows MLS to better take advantage of the sport's global fanbase.
""We were seeing the difficulty of getting an audience and getting the economics right with local and regional television - we saw that in 2018,"" Garber said this week at the Paley International Council Summit.
""We wanted to go to the market with a global package... We have a subscription that's global, every one of our 600 games is treated like 'Monday Night Football'.""

20241115,NFLX,"Disney's (DIS) box office magic is back, and that's taking its stock to one of the happiest places on Earth for investors.
Shares of Disney surged 9% in early trading on Thursday following a solid quarterly earnings beat and upbeat long-term guidance. The company's ticker page was the No. 1 most active on the Yahoo Finance platform.
The advance takes Disney's stock up about 23% year to date, outperforming the 16% gain for the Dow.
""I do think that the focus on raising the bar on quality and delivering, really, I think the best content in the industry is an indication that the magic is back at Disney,"" Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief (video above).
The financial performance of Disney's entertainment business stole the show, no pun intended. Its sales surged 14% on the back of strong performances from Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine. Operating profits hit $1.1 billion, up from $236 million a year ago.
Johnston believes the momentum is poised to continue with key franchise releases of Moana 2 and the Lion King coming up.
The company's parks and linear TV businesses continue to be challenged for several reasons, however.
Sales in Disney's experiences segment — which houses the global theme park business — only rose 1% year over year as cautious consumers kept a lid on spending. Operating income fell 5%. Attendance was relatively unchanged year over year.
Johnston said the parks business is beyond its low point and that he doesn't think venues such as Shanghai Disney would get roped into a potential Trump administration trade war with China.
""We're about bringing smiles to people's faces. We're about creating moments for families. We're about creating joy. That's not a political thing by any stretch of the imagination. And frankly, I think most political leaders would look at Disney and say, you know what? That's something that I want to make sure our citizens get to enjoy,"" Johnston explained.
As for the linear TV network business — which includes ABC and ESPN — sales and profits dropped 6% and 38%, respectively.
The company has undergone rounds of layoffs in its TV business over the past year, but the shift to streaming continues to be fast and furious — likely requiring deeper cost cuts.
Johnston says he ran the numbers for CEO Bob Iger, and it makes more sense to stay in the traditional TV business.
""I think the core for us is really the content creation that comes out of our networks. It plays across both distribution channels, and that's really the most important thing,"" Johnston added.
Story Continues
Despite the weak areas of Disney's vast portfolio, investors appear to be latching on to the view that a rebound in the entertainment business and a more cost-focused Disney is all that matters right now.
""Stepping back, we continue to like the medium-term story for Disney, save for linear networks where expectations we think are set appropriately and ongoing cost cuts could help to soften the rate of decline. Content performance is strong with film releases year to date performing at or well beyond previous franchise iterations, which should fuel demand for Disney+ ahead of a password share crackdown and price increase,"" said JPMorgan analyst David Karnovsky in a client note.
Karnovsky said Disney's renewed success at the box office provides ""confidence"" in further momentum around upcoming releases. He rates Disney shares at Overweight, or the equivalent of a Buy.

20241115,NFLX,"If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) we really liked what we saw.
What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Netflix is:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.23 = US$9.6b ÷ (US$52b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).
Therefore, Netflix has an ROCE of 23%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.
Check out our latest analysis for Netflix
NasdaqGS:NFLX Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Netflix compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Netflix .
The Trend Of ROCE
Netflix is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 23%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 76% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.
In Conclusion...
To sum it up, Netflix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Since the stock has returned a staggering 172% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.
Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our FREE intrinsic value estimation for NFLX that compares the share price and estimated value.

20241115,NFLX,"(Bloomberg) -- For Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of Squid Game, the most popular show in Netflix Inc.’s history, writing and directing all nine of its dark, startling episodes was so intense that he lost seven or eight teeth during the process.

“When I am very tired or stressed, I always have gum problems,” he said during an interview on a soundstage outside of Seoul.
After the end of the first season, Hwang initially had no plans to keep the show going. But in the end, Netflix’s desire for recurring global hits eclipsed any lingering concern about collateral dental damage. Hwang got to work writing more episodes.
On Dec. 26, one day after Netflix shows its first pro football games, the second season of Squid Game will arrive with much fanfare.
“People loved that first season — you saw Halloween costumes and people wanting to play the games and share iconography,” Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer, said in a recent interview. “People wanted more of it. When they love a show, they want to live it, experience it, connect with it.”
According to internal Netflix calculations, the first season of Squid Game had generated $900 million in value for the streaming company shortly after its September 2021 debut. With the arrival of season two, Squid Game stands out as one of the first TV shows from South Korea to spawn a global franchise, spanning everything from reality TV to video games to in-person fan experiences.
Hwang’s anti-capitalist parable originated out of his own desperation. During the 2008 financial crisis, which devastated the South Korean film industry, the screenwriter, now 53, was down on his luck. With just a few credits to his name and less than $10 remaining in his bank account, he wrote a story about a survival game in which indebted, penniless Koreans compete to the death for an unimaginable fortune.
Once completed, the original script proved too confusing, violent and expensive for any buyers in South Korea. While the idea languished unsold, Hwang found work directing a trio of movies for local studios. Eventually, he found a fresh buyer.
Following the introduction of its streaming service in South Korea in 2016, Netflix was on the prowl for programming there that the major broadcast networks and movie studios had overlooked. Enter Hwang. From the start, given the popularity of South Korean film and TV across the region, Netflix’s team in Seoul believed that Squid Game could be a hit in its home country and potentially reach new viewers across Asia, where the streaming giant was investing tens of billions of dollars to grow its presence.
Story Continues
In the fall of 2021, the show — an exploration of just how far despairing people will go to survive amid disturbing conditions — made its debut, landing in a world still intensely stressed-out from the Covid-19 pandemic. Almost overnight, the macabre series blew-up into a global phenomenon, topping Netflix’s list of the most-watched titles on every continent. Critics were similarly impressed, and Squid Game became the first foreign-language program ever nominated for best drama at the Emmy Awards while ricocheting through US culture. Saturday Night Live spoofed it, and YouTube star MrBeast made a real-life, Squid Game-inspired game show — the resulting video has since been viewed more than 660 million times. Netflix told Hwang that if he had a good idea, they’d love to keep the momentum going.
Most Korean dramas last just one season, but Hwang had left the door open to extending the story with the way he ended the final episode — and there were other, economic reasons to press ahead. Netflix had paid for the first season almost entirely up front, so while many cast members would win international prizes and acting roles in Hollywood as a result of its success, they weren’t immediately sharing in the company’s windfall. A few months after the show’s premiere, the streaming giant did pay some of the talent one-time bonuses. Even so, Hwang felt motivated to write more episodes.
As discussions for a second season ramped up, Hwang hired the powerful talent shop Creative Artists Agency as well as a Hollywood law firm that represents clients such as Scarlett Johansson and Matthew McConaughey. In the ensuing negotiations, his new team made sure that he would have plenty of money to address any future dental emergencies.
“We felt doing a second season would provide a more adequate compensation, befitting the success of this show,” Hwang said.
In May 2022, he started writing, eventually mapping out two additional seasons. By the summer of 2023, producers were back at work shooting new scenes at a soundstage outside of Seoul.
With the new programming coming down the pipeline, Netflix looked for other ways to extend the franchise. The company ordered a reality show, adapted from the series and using a similar-looking set. It began developing a multiplayer video game based on the show. In New York, Netflix set up a commercial escape room experience where fans could test their own survival instincts. And the streaming giant held discussions with award-winning director David Fincher, the director of The Social Network and Fight Club, about the possibility of producing an English-language adaptation.
Meanwhile, ahead of the show’s return in December, Netflix is rolling out ads everywhere from TV to billboards to New York subway cars, commencing one of the largest promotional campaigns in the company’s history. At a shopping center in the Philippines, Netflix has erected a replica of a giant, freaky doll that appeared in the first season. Several major consumer brands, including Crocs and Johnnie Walker, have teamed up with the company to create a slew of Squid Game-themed products.
While Squid Game is a global phenomenon, it has paid especially big dividends in Asia, which has surpassed Latin America as the streaming service’s third-biggest region with 52.6 million customers, as of the end of September. In recent years, producers in South Korea have delivered several more global hits for Netflix, including Extraordinary Attorney Woo, All of Us Are Dead and The Glory.
The third and final season of Squid Game will debut in 2025. After that, Hwang said, he’s ready to take a long break. “This is going to be my last series ever,” he said. “I don’t think I will do it ever again. Humanly, physically, mentally, I am just pushing my limit beyond what’s possible.”

20241115,NFLX,"Some wait for their lawyer, agent, or parent, to read their contract. Famed businesswoman and subject of a recent Netflix biopic on her homemaking empire Martha Stewart has none other than Snoop Dogg reading the fine print before she signs on the dotted line.
“I’ve learned how to negotiate even better than ever,” Stewart told the Wall Street Journal, when asked about the lessons she’s gleaned from rapper and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg.
The two forged a friendship and business partnership back in 2008, when Snoop appeared on Stewart’s cooking show. Later, the duo were brought together again for Justin Bieber’s Comedy Central roast.
“At that point Martha had been off the air for a few years,” Meg James, reporter at the Los Angeles Times said in Netflix docuseries Martha. “Culturally she had become pretty irrelevant,” she added of Stewart’s reputation in 2015, still coming off the tails of an insider trading scandal.
She ended up stealing the roast, as Snoop recalled— beginning Stewart’s public departure from the perfectionist image she had cultivated in prior decades. Stewart made her mark on Snoop.
""She sat next to me, and she stole the show. She was the funniest roaster that night,""
Snoop said in a 2019 NBC News interview. ""In that moment I knew I wanted to be alongside this lady for the rest of my life,” he added.
Since then the two have partnered up for public appearances, at one point even helming a reality show called Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party.
At this point, Snoop even reads Stewart’s contracts.“We do a lot of work together, and I wait for him to negotiate the contract, then I go and follow him,” Stewart told the Journal.
He’s likely a good person to contact for business savvy after all, Snoop is reportedly worth $160 million, per Celebrity Net Worth. He’s built an empire off his own name, and is champion for closing the Black wealth gap.
“I’m trying to be one of those examples of someone who creates his own everything, owns his own everything, and has a brand strong enough to compete with Levi’s and Miller and Kraft and all of these other brands that have been around for hundreds of years,” Snoop said in a 2021 interview with the New York Times.
Having a stake in the game is essential for Snoop when it comes to signing off on a product. “I want some equity. Give me a piece of the pie. If I can’t get no equity, [expletive] you and your company,” he told the Times.
Stewart, formerly the first self-made female billionaire, saw her net worth falter after her insider-trading scandal.  Her media empire was valued at more than $1 billion at its height, though it sold for far less in 2015, according to the New York Times. She’s landed on her feet to some degree, as she’s still a millionaire and continues to appear in more projects. Presumably, Snoop has been some help.

20241115,NFLX,"Disney DIS is a stock Wall Street will be watching closely this week with the media conglomerate set to release results for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday, November 14.
With Disney shares up a respectable +13% year to date, investors may be wondering if there is more upside ahead as earnings approach.
Disney’s Q4 Expectations
Disney’s Q4 sales are expected at $22.59 billion, a 6% increase from $21.24 billion in the comparative quarter. More intriguing, Disney’s cost-saving initiatives appear to be working with Q4 earnings projected to increase 33% to $1.09 per share versus EPS of $0.82 a year ago.
Exceeding earnings expectations for seven consecutive quarters, Disney has posted an impressive average EPS surprise of 18.01% in its last four quarterly reports. Disney has exceeded top line estimates in two of the last four quarters with an average sales surprise of 1.05%.
Zacks Investment Research

Disney’s Streaming Memberships
Reductions to its workforce and reduced operating costs among its streaming segments have been the main catalyst for Disney's increased probability.
EPSN+ subscribers are expected at 25.73 million with Disney+ users forecasted at 120 million. However, Disney+ subscribers would reflect a noticeable dip from the 150 million paid members in the same period last year. Still, when including Hulu subscribers which are projected at 51 million, Disney is edging toward 200 million total streaming memberships.
This is second to streaming leader Netflix NFLX who recently reported over 280 million paid memberships in October.
Monitoring Disney’s Valuation
At around $102, Disney’s stock trades at 19.2X forward earnings which is a nice discount to the S&P 500’s 25.3X and Netflix’s 41.4X.
Furthermore, DIS trades at the optimum level of less than 2X sales compared to the S&P 500’s 5.4X and Netflix’s 9X.
Zacks Investment Research

Takeaway
Disney's Q4 results will be crucial to reconfirming the company’s return to growth as its stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That said, long-term investors could certainly be rewarded given Disney’s appealing valuation with the Average Zacks Price Target of $114.92 a share suggesting 14% upside for DIS.

20241115,NFLX,"Cable news took a major ratings hit on election night, a stark reminder of an industry struggling amid a mass shift towards streaming and alternative media.
“There isn't a media executive that doesn't know that there's a problem. There isn't a media executive that isn't actively working on that problem,” former CNN CEO Chris Licht told me at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Tuesday.
“The facts are that people have lost trust in legacy media,” Licht added. The media veteran was the head honcho at CNN from May 2022 to June 2023.
How to fix the issue is the multibillion-dollar question facing the nation’s most powerful news executives, as growing distrust is one of several factors contributing to the industry’s steady ratings decline.
Nielsen data showed TV viewership of the presidential election coverage fell by a quarter from four years ago, with the three largest cable news networks — CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News — all reporting a drop from 2020.
Former CNN CEO Chris Licht (left) with Yahoo Finance anchor Seana Smith (right) at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Nov. 12, 2024.
Recent executive commentary and Q3 results have further highlighted the massive challenges in the industry. Paramount (PARA) reported continued declines in its linear TV business in the third quarter, while Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) saw a 3% year-over-year decline in revenue, fueled in part by cord cutting.
The decreasing viewership has prompted media giants to rethink the strategy surrounding their linear networks.
Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Licht’s former boss, said on his company’s earnings call last week that he’s exploring ""all things operationally and strategically"" to ensure shareholder value.
One of the options long speculated by Wall Street: a potential spinoff. Recent analysis from Bank of America explored a possible split of WBD’s streaming and studio businesses from its traditional linear TV division.

And WBD is far from the only legacy media business that could be headed for a split. Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst Geetha Ranganathan recently told me on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief that “we can expect to see more consolidation” across the industry.
“If there's any sector that is in need of consolidation, it really is the media sector,” Ranganathan said. “There are just so many headwinds right now that are affecting the sector, especially as consumers are migrating in droves away from the linear TV model to the streaming model.”

Despite the increase in cord-cutting and the seemingly inevitable consolidation wave, Licht still believes the cable industry will survive. The networks that adapt successfully won't only see a boost to their bottom lines, but will significantly help society, he said.

“It will absolutely decline … but I think there's a floor. I don't think that one day you're going to wake up and there are zero cable subscriptions,” Licht said.
“Can legacy media reinvent itself in a way that then can reconnect with people and become relevant in their lives again and become trusted? I don't know ... For the people that figure it out, there’s a lot of economic upside, [and upside] for our society,” Licht added.

Two Reasons We Like Netflix
Launched by Reed Hastings as a DVD mail rental company until its famous pivot to streaming in 2007, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is a pioneering streaming content platform.
1. EBITDA Margin Reveals a Well-Run Organization
Investors frequently analyze operating income to understand a business’s core profitability. Similar to operating income, EBITDA is the most common profitability metric for consumer internet companies because it removes various one-time or non-cash expenses, offering a more normalized view of profit potential.
Netflix has been a well-oiled machine over the last two years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a consumer internet business, boasting an average EBITDA margin of 24.2%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it’s a show of well-managed operations if they’re high when gross margins are low.
Netflix EBITDA Margin
2. Free Cash Flow Margin Increased, Juicing Financials
Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.
Taking a step back, we can see that Netflix’s margin expanded by 18.4 percentage points over the last three years. This is encouraging because its free cash flow profitability rose more than its operating profitability, suggesting it’s becoming a less capital-intensive business. Its free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 19%.
Netflix Free Cash Flow Margin
One Reason To Stay Cautious: Customer Spending Decreases… Engagement Falling?
Average revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Netflix because it measures how much the average user spends. ARPU is also a key indicator of how valuable its users are (and can be over time).
Story Continues
Netflix’s ARPU fell over the last two years, averaging 1.4% annual declines. This isn’t great, but the increase in global streaming paid memberships is more relevant for assessing long-term business potential. We’ll monitor the situation closely; if Netflix tries boosting ARPU by taking a more aggressive approach to monetization, it’s unclear whether users can continue growing at the current pace.

Final Judgment
There are definitely things to like about Netflix, and with its shares topping the market in recent months, the stock trades at 29x forward EV-to-EBITDA, or $822.90 per share. Is now a good time to buy?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include including Netflix, Inc.

Top Stock Reports for Netflix, Salesforce and Cisco
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Netflix, Inc., Salesforce, Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, BK Technologies Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Netflix’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past two years (+169.1% vs. +77.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that the planned launch of an in-house ad tech platform next year signals the company's commitment to maximize its revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year in 2025. A robust, localized and foreign-language content lineup and healthy customer engagement levels have helped.
However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ remains a headwind.
(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)
Salesforce’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer – Software industry over the past year (+58.7% vs. +21.3%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving growth. Continued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. Salesforce’s strategy of continuous expansion of generative AI offerings are also helping it to tap the growing opportunities in the space.
Yet, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Softening IT spending amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties might hurt its growth prospects.
(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here >>>)
Shares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the last six months (+20.4% vs. +19.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, the launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, has strengthened the company’s security portfolio. Also, its business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of total revenues.
Story Continues
Yet, Cisco has been suffering from sluggish networking sales as well as stiff competition. Its prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition aggravated by Hewlett Packard’s deal to acquire Juniper.
(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)
BK Technologies’ shares have outperformed the Zack Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+119.5% vs. +52.3%). The Zacks analyst believes that the growing demand for BKR 9000 and BKR 5000 radios have supported revenue growth. Also, a large order backlog and focus on innovation, such as the patented InteropONE solution, strengthens BK's market position.
However, reliance on government contracts, supply-chain risks and limited product diversification pose potential challenges.

To Buy Or Not To Buy: Disney Ahead of Q4 Earnings
The Walt Disney Company is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Nov. 14.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $22.59 billion, suggesting modest growth of 6.37% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.
The consensus mark for earnings has moved south by a penny to $1.09 per share over the past 30 days, indicating growth of 32.93% year over year.
Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.
In the last reported quarter, Disney delivered an earnings surprise of 15.83%. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.01%.

Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Disney this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
DIS has an Earnings ESP of -1.63% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Factors Shaping Upcoming Results
As the media landscape shifts from traditional linear TV to streaming, Disney finds itself in an enviable position. With two robust U.S. streaming services, Disney+ and Hulu, complemented by ESPN+, the entertainment giant is well-equipped to navigate this transition seamlessly.
One of Disney's key advantages is its bundling strategy, which combines these streaming services into a compelling package. This approach is not only expected to have boosted average revenue per account in the to-be-reported quarter but is also likely to have helped reduce customer churn.
In the fiscal fourth quarter, Disney expects Disney+ Core subscribers to grow modestly. The company remains optimistic projecting profitability of the combined streaming businesses to improve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, with both Entertainment DTC and ESPN+ expected to be profitable in the quarter.
Story Continues
However, DIS is likely to have suffered from a persistent decline in Linear TV revenues, which is expected to have negatively impacted Media and Entertainment Distribution revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.
Our model estimates for Entertainment revenues (which include Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing and Other Revenue) are pegged at $9.44 billion, indicating a decrease of 0.8% year over year.
DIS’ true strength lies in its unparalleled portfolio of Intellectual Property (IP). From the iconic Marvel and Star Wars franchises to the beloved Disney princesses, Mickey Mouse and Pixar's timeless classics, the company owns the most powerful collection of IPs in the media industry. This wealth of IP is a significant asset, as it gives audiences an immediate connection to the content, reducing the risk associated with content investments.
The company's extensive library of IP not only fuels its studio operations but also underpins its entire business ecosystem, including streaming, linear networks and the profitable Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products segment.
In the Experiences segment, DIS expects that the demand moderation it saw in domestic businesses in the fiscal third quarter could impact the next few quarters. While the company is actively monitoring attendance and guest spending and aggressively managing the cost base, Disney expects the Experiences segment’s operating income to decline by mid-single digits compared with the prior year, reflecting these underlying dynamics as well as impacts at Disneyland Paris from a reduction in normal consumer travel due to the Olympics and some cyclical softening in China.
As we discuss the quarter under review, investors should pay close attention to key metrics, such as park attendance, per-capita spending and any announcements regarding expansion plans, particularly in international markets. The performance of this segment might have provided a strong foundation for Disney's overall growth trajectory.
Our model estimate for the Experiences segment (renamed from Disney Parks, Experiences and Products) revenues is $9.13 billion, indicating 12% growth year over year.
Despite experiencing strong demand at Disney Cruise Line in the quarter under review, results in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to reflect pre-launch expenses for Disney Adventure and Disney Treasure.
Price Performance & Valuation
Shares of DIS have returned 11.7% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 10%. Disney operates in a fiercely competitive streaming market dominated by the likes of Amazon-owned Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, as well as the growing prominence of services from Apple, Comcast -owned Peacock and HBO Max.
Valuation-wise, Disney is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 19.53X compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s 19.11X, reflecting a stretched valuation. The company’s debt balance of $47.5 billion compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and its current marketable investment securities balance of $5.95 billion.
Investment Considerations: Balancing Risk and Reward
Disney remains a prominent name in the investment world, long revered as a blue-chip stock and a staple in many portfolios. DIS' strength lies in its globally recognized brand and diverse intellectual properties spanning movies, TV shows, theme parks and merchandise. This diverse portfolio has historically given Disney a unique edge in captivating audiences worldwide and generating consistent revenue streams.
However, recent years have brought significant challenges, including disruptions in traditional media, pandemic impacts on theme parks and evolving consumer behaviors. These headwinds have prompted investors to reevaluate Disney's appeal, questioning whether the Magic Kingdom can maintain its former allure in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing entertainment landscape.
Final Thought
Disney remains a diversified media and entertainment powerhouse with a strong brand and valuable intellectual property. Its theme parks and resorts continue to be a significant revenue driver, and the potential for growth in emerging markets of Asia remains promising. However, the accelerating trend of cord-cutting continues to put pressure on this segment, potentially offsetting gains in other areas.
For those considering how to play Disney stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, a nuanced approach may be warranted. Investors with a shorter investment horizon may want to exercise caution and wait for a better entry point, given the uncertainties surrounding the company's growth prospects and the competitive pressure it faces despite the enduring power of the Disney brand.

It’s no secret that all eyes are on the incoming Trump administration and what it might mean for every aspect of living, including markets and the economy.
One term likely to take center stage in the coming weeks as Trump builds out his Cabinet is the reemergence of tariffs and the larger implication on trade and the economy.
“We think and anticipate tariffs will be implemented,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, to Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below).
Luzzetti said tariffs will negatively impact economic growth.
Tariffs were a significant measure during the first Trump administration.
Trump imposed more than $300 billion in duties on Chinese goods. President Joe Biden largely re-upped Trump's policy in May — and added new tariffs on certain sectors on top.
Biden exclusively told Sozzi at the time the fresh tariffs were about ""being fair.""
Looking ahead to the new administration, one proposed move involves a baseline tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports with an eye toward bolstering US manufacturing. Trump has also floated stiffer tariffs on China, and new ones on Mexico.
“The jury’s out. We know the short run effects [from tariffs] so far from 2019, which is that it improved the trade balance with China, but didn’t necessarily improve the trade balance more broadly,” Luzzetti said.
The great economic unknown on tariffs was echoed by top leaders such as Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan at this week's Yahoo Finance Invest conference.

Luzzetti ultimately views the data from Trump's first term as useful when forecasting what could be in the cards this time around.
The tariffs of 2019 focused heavily on China alongside materials like steel and aluminum. Luzzetti notes that what the economy of 2019 experienced “was some uplift in inflation.""
“[The] economy did come under pressure as a result of the tariffs,” he said. “Now, it sparked a trade war. Financial markets took it very negatively.”
China experienced a devaluation in its currency and in turn, global market sell-offs ensued.
“But you can actually see the manufacturing sector, industrial production had picked up in 2018 and then it was down negative in 2019,” Luzzetti pointed out. “We have clear evidence that tariffs do work as we expect, which is a negative supply shock for the economy in the short term.”

Since the election results last Tuesday, markets have ignored tariff risk, in some cases rising to record highs on news of Trump’s victory. Closely watched stocks with global financial exposure such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) have also hovered near records.
""We have learned [there] cannot just be tariffs on one particular country, because it is unlikely that [it] reorients that production, say, out of China into the US,” Luzzetti warns. “There’s a lot of other stopping places that you get to before that.”

Factors Shaping NVIDIA’s Upcoming Results
The continued strength of its Datacenter business on the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA’s third-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.
The Datacenter end-market business is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to have aided the segment’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Datacenter end market is pegged at $28.48 billion, which indicates robust year-over-year growth of 96%.
Moreover, NVIDIA’s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market’s last five quarters’ results improved year over year as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products. Revenues from the Gaming end market increased 16% year over year to $2.88 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Gaming end market stands at $3.11 billion, which implies a 9% increase from the year-ago quarter.
Story Continues
NVIDIA’s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing in the four consecutive quarters. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter for the end market. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Professional Visualization end market is pegged at $557 million, which suggests a 34% increase from the year-ago quarter.
The company’s Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in eight of the last nine quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal third quarter due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $340 million, which indicates year-over-year growth of 30%.
NVIDIA Stock Price Performance & Valuation
Year to date (YTD), NVDA stock has skyrocketed 196.2%, outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s growth of 139.5%. Moreover, NVIDIA shares have outpaced the gains of major chip makers, including Micron MU, Marvell Technology MRVL and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.

Investment Consideration for NVDA
Over the past year, NVIDIA’s revenue growth has been fueled by robust demand for chips needed for generative AI model development. NVIDIA dominates the market for generative AI chips, which have already proven useful across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.
The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.
However, the complexity of generative AI, which demands vast knowledge and immense computational power, means that enterprises will need to upgrade their network infrastructures significantly. NVIDIA’s AI chips, including the A100, H100 and B100, are the top choices for building and running these powerful AI applications, positioning the company as a leader in this space. As the generative AI revolution unfolds, we expect NVIDIA's advanced chips to drive substantial growth in both its revenues and market presence.
NVDA: In a Nutshell
As a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into AI, data centers and autonomous vehicles. The company's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity.
While NVDA stock’s premium valuation might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to its consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. The company enjoys high market esteem, and savvy investors should consider leveraging NVDA’s potential for sustained long-term growth.

Thankfully, the next dip will likely be bought up rather quickly given how upbeat Wall Street is about the likelihood of lower corporate taxes, less red tape, and economic growth-focused efforts during a second Trump term. Wall Street is also pleased with the outlook for earnings growth and the Fed’s rate cut projections.
Even though the market is rather overheated, with Nvidia and others trading right near all-time highs, several impressive AI stocks are already trading well below their records.
Why Taiwan Semiconductor Stock is a Great Buy and Hold Tech Investment
Nvidia, Apple, and other technology heavyweights rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM to build their most cutting-edge chips.
Taiwan Semi pioneered the dedicated semiconductor foundry business model that transformed TSM into the most dominant player in the vital industry, earning a reported 61% of the semiconductor foundry market share in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Taiwan Semi is ramping up its industry-leading 3-nanometer technology, which is fueling the AI boom and beyond. Shipments of Taiwan Semi’s 3-nanometer chips accounted for 20% of total Q3 wafer revenue, up from 15% in Q2, with “advanced technologies” making up 69%.

The costs and institutional knowledge required to build the most cutting-edge semiconductors create an almost impenetrable moat around Taiwan Semi. TSM is addressing geopolitical fears by expanding its manufacturing footprint beyond Taiwan into Japan and the U.S. On top of that, Taiwan Semi pays a dividend and its balance sheet is solid.
TSM posted another beat-and-raise quarter in mid-October, providing upbeat AI-boosted guidance again. The chip maker is projected to grow sales by roughly 26% in 2024 and 24% in FY25 to soar from $69 billion in 2023 to $108 billion next year. Taiwan Semi is projected to boost its adjusted earnings by 30% and 28%, respectively. And its upbeat EPS outlook helps it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Taiwan Semi stock has more than tripled the Zacks Tech sector over the past 20 years. TSM has climbed 255% in the past five years and 80% YTD. Yet TSM stock trades 9% below its mid-October highs and 19% below its average Zacks price target. TSM stock is attempting to find support at its 50-day moving average.
On the valuation side, Taiwan Semi trades at a 34% discount to its 10-year highs at 22.3X forward 12-month earnings and 17% below the Zacks Tech sector—Nvidia (NVDA) trades at 43.5X.
Why CEG is a Must-Own AI and Nuclear Energy Stock
Constellation Energy CEG cemented the long-term relationship between nuclear and AI when it secured its 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft in September.
Constellation is the largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator, boasting over 20 reactors at roughly a dozen sites across the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast. Constellation is retrofitting its current nuclear power plants to keep them running for a lot longer, reopening decommissioned plants, and venturing into next-gen nuclear technologies.
Constellation benefits from the U.S. government’s active support for nuclear energy expansion. The U.S. earlier this week doubled down on its pledge to triple its nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “The importance of AI and the data economy to America’s economic competitiveness and national security can’t be overstated, and Constellation will do our part to meet the moment,” CEO Joe Dominguez said in prepared Q3 remarks.
Zacks Investment Research

CEG posted solid Q3 results on November 4, pointing to “visible, double-digit long-term base EPS growth backed by the Nuclear Production Tax Credit.” CEG has boosted its balance sheet in 2024. This should help it grow through mergers and acquisitions and return more value to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.
Constellation announced in early 2024 its plans to boost its dividend per share by 25% in 2024, exceeding its 10% annual growth target.
Constellation shares have surged 95% YTD (10th best S&P 500 stock) and 145% in the last two years. CEG has dropped since its release as investors took home profits following its massive run. The nuclear energy giant is trading 20% below its early October highs and 22% below its average Zacks price target.
Constellation stock is trading at some of its lowest RSI levels over the past 12 months. CEG is also attempting to find support near its May highs. If Constellation stock falls to its 200-day moving average it might offer a great entry point for traders and long-term investors.
Buy This AI Semiconductor Stock Down 35% from Its Highs?
Micron Technology, Inc. MU is one of the largest makers of memory chips. MU’s offerings are found in PCs, smartphones, and most critically these days, data centers. Micron said earlier this year that AI will drive record demand for memory chips. Micron is currently a key memory chip supplier for Nvidia’s AI processors. Micron plans to build a leading-edge memory “megafab” to help meet growing memory chip demand.
Micron topped our Q4 FY24 earnings estimate in late September on the back of 93% YoY revenue growth, driven by “robust AI demand.” Micron is projected to grow its revenue by 52% in FY25 and another 25% next year to climb from $25 billion in FY24 to $48 billion in FY26 (following 61% YoY expansion in FY24).
Zacks Investment Research

MU’s earnings outlook has dipped slightly recently. Still, Micron’s FY26 consensus estimate is up 230% during the past 12 months. Micron is projected to more than double its adjusted earnings in FY25 (+130%) and 45% next year to expand from $1.30 a share in FY24 to $12.55 next year.
Wall Street dumped the historically volatile stock following its rally to all-time highs in June. Samsung and others are ramping up their memory chip efforts. But Micron’s growth outlook remains stellar, and 23 of the 27 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys” and it pays a dividend.
MU stock has climbed 190% in the past 10 years, lagging tech’s 320%. Yet MU has soared 1,200% in the last 15 vs. Tech’s 620%. Micron trades 35% below its summer records and 46% below its average Zacks price target. MU is trying to find support near its 50-week and 50-day moving averages. MU is also trading at a 60% discount to tech at 10.9X forward earnings and near its 10-year median.

20241115,NVDA,"Nvidia Set For Gains From AI Cloud Demand, Blackwell Launch, And Data Center Expansion: Analyst
Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer maintained Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) with an Outperform rating and raised the price target from $150 to $175.
Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer has reiterated his bullish stance on Nvidia ahead of the company’s third-quarter earnings report scheduled for November 20. Schafer anticipates substantial upside in Nvidia’s October quarter results and January quarter guidance, driven by consistent demand from cloud service providers (CSPs) and enterprise clients for AI accelerators.
Also Read: Nvidia Powers Tesla’s Humanoid Robots With New AI Tech: Here’s What To Expect In 2025
Schafer has revised his estimates upward, citing robust traction for Nvidia’s Hopper AI accelerators and the initial ramp-up of the new Blackwell chips, which will likely begin in the fourth quarter.
He projects that Blackwell will contribute several billion dollars in revenue for the January quarter despite ongoing supply constraints related to CoWoS-L capacity.
The analyst foresees a significant acceleration in Blackwell sales by the first quarter (April), with investors modeling between 5-6 million GPUs next year.
In 2025, Schafer expects the product mix to favor drop-in HGX modules and air-cooled NVL36 GB200 racks as they integrate more easily into existing data center infrastructures. He stated that liquid cooling challenges may take time to resolve.
Nvidia’s rack-scale solutions, which include CPUs and networking components, could offer a 10 times increase in average selling prices (ASP) compared to standalone modules.
Schafer sees Nvidia’s Data Center (DC) segment, which comprises 87% of total revenue, growing 9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and 97% year-over-year (YoY) in the third quarter, led by the H200 chip.
The broader Blackwell product line will likely ramp up in the first quarter, with future iterations like the Blackwell Ultra scheduled for late 2025. Schafer estimates that 60% of the data center sales will come from training, while 40% will be from inference.
He forecasts over $10 billion in sales from sovereign AI projects this year, although this may face long-term risks from potential U.S. export restrictions.
For the Networking segment, accounting for 14% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, Schafer projects a 9% QoQ increase and 60% YoY growth, driven by robust Spectrum-X Ethernet switches and DPUs shipments.
He expects Nvidia’s next-generation Spectrum-X800 to launch in 2025, catering to large-scale accelerator clusters, followed by the Spectrum-X1600 in 2026.
In the Gaming segment, which makes up 10% of revenue, Schafer anticipates 5% QoQ and 6% YoY growth in the third quarter, fueled by strong sales of discrete PC GPUs.
Story Continues
He highlighted the upcoming launch of Nvidia’s 50-series Blackwell GPUs in early 2025, alongside a 3nm PC CPU developed in collaboration with MediaTek.
Schafer estimates Nvidia’s free cash flow (FCF) to be $16.5 billion for the third quarter, with $97 billion projected for the full year 2025. He stated that Nvidia has $57.5 billion remaining on its stock buyback authorization, with cash and debt balances of $34.8 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.
Based on revised earnings estimates, Schafer raised his calendar year 2024, 2025, and 2026 EPS forecasts to $2.85, $4.16, and $5.04, up from previous estimates of $2.80, $3.77, and $4.51.
He also increased his price target for Nvidia stock, citing improved free cash flow and a stronger balance sheet. Nvidia trades 29 times his calendar year 2026 EPS estimate, below its five-year average of 37 times.
Schafer views Nvidia as a long-term buy, highlighting its leading position in AI hardware and software, strong gross and operating margins, and dominant data center ecosystem as core drivers of sustained growth.
Nvidia stock surged 205% year-to-date as U.S. Big Techs splurged on their AI ambitions. Investors can gain exposure to the AI wave through Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) and Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ).
Price Action: NVDA stock traded lower by 0.22% at $146.45 premarket at the last check on Friday.

Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Nvidia in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on November 20, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $0.74 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 85%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $32.81 billion, indicating an 81.07% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.
For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $2.82 per share and a revenue of $124.9 billion, signifying shifts of +116.92% and +105.01%, respectively, from the last year.

20241115,MSFT,"Recently, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has started to focus on Microsoft's (MSFT, Financial) Cloud business more than ever by launching an investigation of anti-competitive behavior. The investigation is explicitly centered on the Microsoft Azure cloud-computing service and accusations that the company's case with rivals makes it hard for customers to move their data to competitors. Some of the examined strategies include steep abandonment charges, high subscription rate increases, and possible conflict of Microsoft Office 365 with the cloud services of other firms.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.
This move comes after Microsoft became dominant in the cloud market, and they compete with Amazon (AMZN, Financial) and Google (GOOG, Finanial) companies, which are also experiencing growing regulatory scrutiny. Microsoft has most of its influence in the American government domains where its products, such as email domains, have been recently attacked. These incidents have raised concerns regarding the firm's CYBERSECURITY and whether the bundle strategies result in reduced COMPETITION, making it more expensive for federal agencies to consider other options.
The investigation forms part of the Biden administration's broader campaign to reign in the anti-competitive practices of large technology firms. Microsoft has remained silent, but the result could have a major strategic impact on its structure and the firm's place in the cloud economy.

Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday’s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there’s a catch.
“What if the Treasury doesn’t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.”
READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks and Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins
Even though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.
Cramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump’s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board—on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains—no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it’s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:
“If it’s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses… It has always worked for the stock market.”
But Cramer warned that there’s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market’s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.

“If you believe we’re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.”

Microsoft (MSFT)’s AI Surge: Why Cramer Sees Big Potential in This Rapidly Growing Stock
A development team working together to create the next version of Windows.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Cramer pointed out how software stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) took off on Tuesday.
“As is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn’t make a lot of sense and… we’re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.”
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a prominent technology company known for developing and supporting a wide range of software, services, devices, and solutions. The company has positioned itself well to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for generative AI software, an area that Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts will see a massive increase in spending. By 2032, generative AI software spending is expected to rise by 2,790%, approaching $320 billion and growing at an annual rate of 52%.
The company has been tapping into this opportunity by focusing on generative AI copilots, which have shown promising early results. During the first quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that the company’s AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion in the next quarter, making it the fastest-growing business in the company’s history to achieve this milestone.
Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Nadella also pointed out that the use of Azure OpenAI has more than doubled in the past six months, reflecting the increasing adoption of AI-driven solutions. Additionally, AI has played a significant role in driving growth in the company’s cloud services, contributing approximately one-third of the cloud services sales growth in the most recent quarter.
Overall, MSFT ranks 6th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time  frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Thill noted, ""MSFT feels it has more conviction in this cycle than it had in Cloud due to its leading position in AI whereas it was behind AWS (AMZN, Financials) in Cloud."" Jefferies analysts expressed belief that these investments ""will pay off, but it will be a LT journey, not an immediate impact.""
Microsoft said that, with use increasing quarter-over-quarter during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, adoption and use of its AI-powered Microsoft 365 Copilot had exceeded expectations. Expected to rise by another 14% in the current quarter, M365 Commercial Cloud growth climbed 16% in the first quarter.

20241115,MSFT,"(Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is preparing to launch an investigation into anti-competitive practices at Microsoft's cloud computing business, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
The agency is examining allegations that the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, the sources said.
The Financial Times first reported the probe on Thursday.
Tactics being examined include substantially increasing subscription fees for those that leave, charging steep exit fees and allegedly making its Office 365 products incompatible with rival clouds, according to the report.

20241115,CRWD,"Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.
What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for CrowdStrike Holdings, this is the formula:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.012 = US$53m ÷ (US$7.2b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).
Thus, CrowdStrike Holdings has an ROCE of 1.2%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 9.0%.
See our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings
NasdaqGS:CRWD Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024
In the above chart we have measured CrowdStrike Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CrowdStrike Holdings for free.
What Can We Tell From CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE Trend?
The fact that CrowdStrike Holdings is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 1.2% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 439% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.
Our Take On CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE
In summary, it's great to see that CrowdStrike Holdings has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CrowdStrike Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.

This outperformance has made investors wonder if this is the right time to buy or hold CRWD stock and wait for more stability. Here’s why maintaining a hold strategy could be the most prudent move.
Resilience in CRWD’s Financial Performance Post Outage
CrowdStrike’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company’s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.
The company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm’s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.
This robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike’s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company’s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.
CrowdStrike’s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation
CrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.
The Falcon platform’s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike’s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.

CrowdStrike’s Market Position and Customer Loyalty
CrowdStrike’s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm’s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.
Moreover, the company's “Falcon Flex” subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.
Navigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike
Despite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company’s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management’s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.
Analysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.

Potential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike’s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.
CrowdStrike’s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern
CrowdStrike’s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry’s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.

Conclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now
While CrowdStrike’s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.
CrowdStrike’s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241115,CRWD,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Performing Cybersecurity Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.
Data Breaches to Disruptions
The technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025—a 300% increase from 2015 levels.
A Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.
AI Meets Cybercrime
As AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.
AI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. “Cyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,” noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.
Nonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 “will be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,” yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI’s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively—closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.

The constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.

Our Methodology
To compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)
Year-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.
Earlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike’s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn’t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.
CrowdStrike’s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon’s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.
ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.”
Overall, CRWD ranks 6th on our list of  best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241115,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
CrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
CrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

20241115,CRWD,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.
Is Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?
On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.
Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.
McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.
McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.”
On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.
Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.
He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.
Story Continues
As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.

20241115,CRWD,"For many, the main point of investing in the stock market is to achieve spectacular returns. While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. For example, the CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) share price is up a whopping 452% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. It's also good to see the share price up 37% over the last quarter.
Since it's been a strong week for CrowdStrike Holdings shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.
View our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings
Given that CrowdStrike Holdings only made minimal earnings in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue to gauge its business development. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.
In the last 5 years CrowdStrike Holdings saw its revenue grow at 39% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Fortunately, the market has not missed this, and has pushed the share price up by 41% per year in that time. Despite the strong run, top performers like CrowdStrike Holdings have been known to go on winning for decades. On the face of it, this looks lke a good opportunity, although we note sentiment seems very positive already.

20241115,CRWD,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's current watchlist.
Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on stocks that could perform well regardless of who ends up running the White House. On Tuesday, Cramer observed that the day’s market performance gave the impression that every stock could go higher no matter who secures the presidency.
He pointed to significant gains across various sectors, including aerospace, housing, retail, and healthcare. Cramer noted that this broad-based rally resulted in strong performances on Tuesday, with the Dow climbing 427 points, the S&P rising by 1.23%, and the NASDAQ soaring by 1.43%. However, he tempered his optimism by adding that days like Tuesday might prove to be outliers in the coming weeks.

Cramer took the opportunity to highlight ten stocks he believes will thrive and said:
“I want to highlight ten stocks that I believe will do well under either candidate, a who’s who of acclamation, companies that almost have to do well because of seismic trends and savvy managements. Companies that no White House would get hung up on, either because they’re beneath notice or they’re perceived as good corporate citizens by both sides. Stocks in industries that neither Trump nor Harris have ever targeted in the past.”
He also raised an important question for the viewers: “If you had the results of the election in hand, would you really know what to buy or sell?” According to Cramer, answering that question is far more complicated than it seems. He emphasized his list of stocks that can thrive regardless of the election outcome. These are companies that have no clear political adversaries in Washington, making them relatively safe bets. Cramer acknowledged, however, that many stocks that seem like obvious picks for one candidate or another often have hidden dynamics that don’t get enough attention.
“In the end, this presidential prognostication game is meaningless until we start hearing about cabinet appointments, those will tell us a lot. Then, we can figure out really who the winners and losers are. Right now, though, there are just too many political angles to every single stock story.”

For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 5.

Cramer said that he is a  big believer of cybersecurity, which is why his trust owns CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock.
“Hey, speaking of hating to lose the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, that's Desh Aurora, and the CEO of CrowdStrike, that's George Kurtz, are both extremely competitive. They know how to stop cybercrime better than anyone. I know it hurts our diversification efforts, but the Charitable Trust owns both these stocks because I'm a huge believer in cybersecurity and I'm not gonna be left behind by a great stock here. There's so much crime happening online. These companies literally can't handle all the business. Imagine that, I call that a high-quality problem.”
CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) offers cybersecurity solutions. It is known for its Falcon platform, a comprehensive suite of endpoint security solutions. Despite facing challenges earlier this year due to an outage that temporarily impacted its reputation, the company continues to be regarded as a top player in its field. During the fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings call, which ended on July 31, CEO George Kurtz acknowledged that the outage caused some prospective customers to delay signing contracts.
However, he emphasized that most of these deals remain active in the sales pipeline, indicating that the company’s position in the market is still strong. Its Falcon platform offers a wide range of security tools, with 28 modules available to customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, 65% of its customers were using at least five of these modules. The number of deals involving eight or more modules saw a significant increase, up 66% compared to the same period last year.
CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) uses generative AI to detect threats and respond to potential breaches more rapidly. The company claims to have ""the industry's most complete AI-native defense,"" positioning its technology as highly advanced. Its AI models are trained on data from more than 2 trillion incidents every day, enabling them to continually improve in terms of both speed and accuracy. This sophisticated approach to threat detection is central to the company’s value proposition and has helped maintain its reputation as a leader in endpoint security.
Overall CRWD ranks 5th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks that can do well regardless of who wins. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

20241115,CRWD,"We recently published a list of 12 AI News and Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news.
CNBC’s Deidre Bosa joined ‘Money Movers’ to discuss the potential impact of a second Trump administration on the artificial intelligence trade. Bosa notes that artificial intelligence could be “less regulated” and “more volatile” under Trump's leadership. However, the president-elect’s AI policy could be a boon to the industry itself, albeit at the expense of necessary guardrails for AI. Back in June, Republicans adopted a new party platform containing a provision related to scrapping Biden’s executive orders on AI.
READ ALSO: 10 AI News You Shouldn’t Miss and 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News
Biden’s executive orders sought to tackle new technology threats by requiring developers of powerful AI systems to share their safety test results with the US government and also called on federal agencies to develop guidelines for the responsible use of AI domains. On the other hand, Trump’s allies have been proposing a different executive order that would launch a series of “Manhattan Projects” for developing military technology and immediately review “unnecessary and burdensome regulations” to “Make America Great in AI”.
Trump, however, seems to be only one of the few who thinks imposing guardrails on artificial intelligence could prove detrimental to the US. A poll shared with Time reveals that Americans across the political spectrum are skeptical about the idea that the U.S. should avoid regulating AI to outcompete China. According to a poll by the AI Policy Institute (AIPI), 75% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans believe that “taking a careful controlled approach” to AI is preferable as opposed to “moving forward on AI as fast as possible to be the first country to get extremely powerful AI.”
The Latest Developments in AI
Amid the ongoing debate, recent developments in AI are rapidly shaping the landscape in the backdrop. For instance, Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine, is said to be raising new investment that would value the search startup to a staggering $9 billion. The new funding round is set to raise $500 million led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which also holds a board seat in the startup.
In other news, OpenAI, an AI research lab and company, has acquired Chat.com, further adding to its collection of high-profile domain names. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the acquisition via email. While such AI-related news is often striking, AI capabilities continue to surprise even the most seasoned experts. In fact, AI can now even help you become a better parent. On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz's partner Justine Moore took to X to share an investment idea, advocating for ""a new wave of 'parenting co-pilots' powered by LLMs and agents. She highlighted companies such as Cradlewise, creators of an AI-driven baby monitor that tracks sleep patterns and rocks the crib, and Nanit, which utilizes AI to analyze crib footage and monitor a baby's breathing.

According to the ""Hyperscale Data Centers - Global Strategic Business Report"", the global market for hyperscale data centers is estimated to reach US$730.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 23.1% from 2023 to 2030. From the increasing adoption of cloud services to the rise of big data and artificial intelligence, several factors are at play when it comes to its rapid growth. As per the report, the biggest driver is cloud computing, with more and more companies migrating their workloads to the cloud to reduce costs, improve scalability, and enhance flexibility.

These hyperscalers need a lot of energy to run their data centers around the clock. According to McKinsey & Company, data center power needs are expected to grow three times higher than the current capacity by the end of the decade, from between 3 and 4 percent of total US power demand today to between 11 and 12 percent in 2030. Naturally, the power sector has become a significant AI player. Several technology companies are looking at nuclear power, including the use of small modular reactors (SMR), to meet their electricity needs.
“Driven by recent trends in AI development, projected power consumption by data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase in the range from 8% to 17% by 2030—or potentially even higher, as progress in AI technologies is not linear but exponential, as seen in Silicon Valley today”.
Recent AI News
As the demand for advanced computing power grows, the latest AI breakthroughs are reshaping industries and driving innovation at an unprecedented pace. Then again, nothing is perfect. A few days back, OpenAI’s premier chatbot, ChatGPT, went down for a total of 30 minutes. According to an outage tracking website Downdetector, over 19,000 people were impacted due to the chatbot’s unavailability. Sam Altman, the CEO, admitted to the outage on X and apologized.
The same company is said to be hitting stumbling blocks recently. That’s because, according to Bloomberg, its latest model Orion hasn’t been performing as well as the developers had hoped for. OpenAI, however, isn’t the only company seemingly facing a plateau. Three leading AI companies are now seeing diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build newer models.

In other news, search habits are changing across the globe now that artificial intelligence is here. According to research from Yext, a digital presence platform for multi-location brands, 45% of customers are likely to use and trust an AI tool for finding more information about a brand, while 51% now use social media, and 28% turn to voice assistants.
“Google impressions have dropped 8-20% in the past two years, pushing marketers to adapt as search behaviour shifts with AI-driven overviews, chatbots and social media searches. Instagram and TikTok have become favoured alternative search engines, particularly for younger consumers”.

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Market Capitalization: $823.05 billion
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. It designs chips for companies that are building AI data centers.
On November 12, Citi analyst Christopher Danely noted that recent earnings saw semiconductor consensus estimates dropping by 11% while the SOX index, which measures semiconductor stocks, fell by 9%. The declines largely come from Microchip, NXP Semiconductors, and Intel; but the firm believes that the selloff is “almost over and attention will shift to 2025”. Citi further states that industrial market struggles will end sometime in the first half of 2025. Since 75% of semiconductor demand looks solid, investors should start investing more in them going into Q1. One of its Buy-rated names is Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). Broadcom has also been deemed an important stock by Jefferies analysts, who expect outperformance from it later in 2025.
Overall AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

AVGO Shares Trading at a Premium
AVGO stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.

Conclusion
The Growth Score of C reflects apprehensions over AVGO’s prospects, which, along with stretched valuation, makes Broadcom a risky bet.

However, Broadcom’s strong portfolio, along with an expanding partner base, surely reflects solid top-line growth potential. We believe these factors justify the premium valuation.

Artificial Intelligence is driving an unprecedented expansion in the potential market size for hardware and software products. According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the “CNBC Connect” event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI’s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology.
“Three years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you”.

Latest Developments in AI
Let’s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported.
In other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation’s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC’s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation.

Speaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training—the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures—have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring “test-time compute,” a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called “inference” phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia’s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market.

20241115,AVGO,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Performing Cybersecurity Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.
Data Breaches to Disruptions
The technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025—a 300% increase from 2015 levels.
A Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.
AI Meets Cybercrime
As AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.
AI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. “Cyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,” noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.
Nonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 “will be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,” yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI’s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively—closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.
Story Continues
The constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.

Our Methodology
To compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Year-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 69.19%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 130
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology powerhouse known for its expertise in semiconductor design, development, and supply, alongside its enterprise software and security solutions. The company’s cybersecurity portfolio includes a range of products, such as its Symantec Enterprise Cloud platform, as well as solutions for payment, mainframe, network, endpoint, and identity security.
In the third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, marking a 47% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and solid non-AI semiconductor performance. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects its AI revenue to rise 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the total for the year to $12 billion, primarily fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.
On November 5, BofA reaffirmed its Buy rating on AVGO, citing the company's leadership in AI computing and networking, along with its strong free cash flow. However, the bank lowered its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast due to seasonal challenges, particularly stemming from a product transition with Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) that is expected to affect revenue in the first half of the year. Still, Broadcom’s position is expected to be buoyed by new AI and networking contracts, along with further opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to adjusted earnings per share of $7.31 by 2026. As AI adoption continues to grow, Broadcom’s focus on high-performance AI networking solutions, especially in complement to NVIDIA’s Blackwell architecture, could potentially strengthen its future prospects.
Overall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of  best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Analyst Blayne Curtis highlighted that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are strategically positioned to capitalize on the AI chip market surge. Curtis has assigned Buy ratings to each of these companies.
Jensen Huang-led Nvidia is experiencing extraordinary demand that surpasses its rapidly growing capacity, Curtis noted. Major tech firms are increasing their investments in GPUs and internal ASIC programs, he added. Despite this, Nvidia is expected to maintain its dominant market share, with room for ASICs to expand, Barron’s reported on Tuesday.

Curtis projects the AI accelerator market to expand by 58% annually, growing from $47 billion in 2023 to $287 billion by 2027. He sees no slowdown in capital expenditure from tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta.
Marvell and Nvidia are expected to see the most immediate gains, with Broadcom likely to outperform later in 2025. Currently, Broadcom’s AI chip business is largely driven by Google by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), but Curtis anticipates broader adoption in the coming years. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also disclosed in late June the purchase of 20 call options in Broadcom.
Price Action: At the time of writing on Tuesday, Nvidia was down by 1.09%, Marvell was trading 0.90% lower while Broadcom was down by 0.067%, as per Benzinga Pro.

20241115,AVGO,"We recently published a list of UBS’ Top Quant Stocks In AI, IT, Healthcare & Other Sectors: Top 33 Stocks In All Sectors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other UBS’ top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors.
With the third quarter of the 2024 earnings season underway, Wall Street is dealing with a changing stock market environment. The Federal Reserve has started its interest rate reduction cycle and market watchers are on the lookout for labor market and inflationary indicators to determine whether the Fed will be able to meet its goal of reducing interest rates by an additional 50 basis points by the end of this year.
Simultaneously, the shifting economic climate is also creating changes in the investment environment. High interest rates traditionally do not mean well for certain stock market sectors barring exceptional circumstances. Some sectors that don’t perform well in a high-rate environment include real estate, healthcare, and technology.
For two of these, this has been the case in the 2022 – 2024 Federal Reserve interest rate hiking cycle as well. Starting from real estate, the flagship S&P index’s real estate sector’s annualized three-year return is currently -2.66%. From its peak of 324.75 in December 2021, the index has lost 48.2 points or 14.8%. Similarly, the high-end healthcare and biotechnology sector does not fare well during high interest rates either. Since 2021’s close, the S&P’s pharmaceutical stock index is down by -0.84% while the S&P’s biotechnology index has lost a sizable 12.61%.
This brings us to our third stock market sector, a.k.a, technology. Technology, as you’re likely aware, has seen a lot of investor interest due to the surge in artificial intelligence. Looking at the performance of the S&P’s technology stock index, its performance also mirrors real estate and healthcare stocks before the frenzy around artificial intelligence started. Between 2021’s close and the market’s bottom in October 2022, the index had lost 33%. During the same time period, the real estate, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology stock indexes had lost 34.8%, 12.2%, and 30.5%, respectively. However, market optimism surrounding artificial intelligence has created a clear bifurcation in performance.
As an example, while real estate stocks have gained 29% since the October 2022 bottom and biotechnology stocks have added 25% in value, information technology stocks are up by a whopping 115%. This shows that tech stocks have delivered 4x the returns of both real estate and biotechnology. Driving this is artificial intelligence, with the shares of the world’s premier AI GPU designer up by 690% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT.
Story Continues
Looking at these shifts, the next question to ask is which stock market sectors might benefit from the evolving environment moving forward. On this front, investment bank UBS has some insights. In its Equity Compass Report issued in mid-October, the bank identifies key themes and trends for US and global stock markets. Within global and US stock market sectors, the bank has rated only one sector as ‘Most Attractive’. Unsurprisingly, this is the US technology sector which is currently experiencing a sustained surge of investor optimism courtesy of artificial intelligence.
The bank shares several data points to justify its optimism in the US technology sector, and more specifically, artificial intelligence companies. Citing data from the Hugging Face repository, a collection of software development tools, it reveals “an average 200% y/y rise for new AI models and model downloads combined so far in 2024.” UBS is also optimistic about the growing adoption of artificial intelligence in the US business world. AI adoption is key since big technology firms that have invested billions of dollars in AI need it to generate returns on their investment.
As per UBS, data from the Census Bureau’s Business Trends and Outlook (BTOS) survey released in September 2024 shows that AI adoption across the 1.2 million firms tracked was picking up the pace. “In the survey, 5.9% of companies reported using AI as of 3Q24, up from 3.7% in 3Q23,” outlined the bank in its report. Not only did 5.9% of the firms adopt AI, but the survey’s outlook for the next six months revealed that AI adoption across the surveyed population could rise by 2.8 percentage points to sit at 8.7%. Commenting on the implications of the higher adoption, UBS stated that “increasing future adoption will increase visibility on AI monetization, which is consistent with recent comments from leading cloud platforms.” The firms slated to benefit the most from this monetization are those ” with strong footprints in existing customer bases,” believes the bank.
These statements necessitate asking the question of which industries are slated to benefit the most from AI adoption. Fortunately for us, UBS also shares data for the industries currently leading the way with AI adoption and those that could grow adoption in the future. Right now, the information technology and personal services sectors are leading with AI adoption since as of September 2024, their respective adoption percentages were 19.1% and 14.7%. For the next six months, while the same industries are expected to lead the pack in overall AI adoption through their 23% and 19.8% percentages, others are expected to make higher percentage point gains. Two industries that stand out in the report are educational services and the finance and insurance industries.
As per the report, the former is expected to increase its AI adoption by 5.6 percentage points to 18.7% over the next six months from the current value of 13.1%. For the finance and insurance sector, it is expected to mark a 6.2 percentage point jump to 13.4% from the existing AI adoption of 7.2%. Of course, while AI is by far the most popular sector in the market right now, UBS also shares other attractive areas. It outlines that the market “also offers exposure to secular growth in longevity through various US medical device companies. Many US companies are also playing leading roles in the energy transition via electric vehicles, renewables, and energy efficiency.”
Our Methodology
To make our list of UBS stocks with improving quantitative indicators, we chose the firm’s top stocks that are seeing improvements in EPS growth, P/E ratio, and other indicators. Stocks within each sector were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. The sectors themselves were ranked by the cumulative number of funds invested in the firms.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Broadcom Inc (AVGO): AI Growth with Custom Chips and VMWare Boost
A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 130
Sector: Information Technology
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. The firm operates in the hardware and software industries. Its key strengths lie on the former front, with Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) responsible for providing networking and custom chips for a wide variety of use cases. These provide the firm with large customers like Apple and have enabled it to establish a foothold in the AI industry. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) benefits from AI through its custom chips, and word on the street is that the firm has partnered up with OpenAI to develop a custom chip. Yet, reliance on customers like Apple is a double-edged sword as it also exposes Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to revenue losses in case its customers decide to develop custom chips. On the software front, the firm’s VMWare acquisition has enabled it to sizably grow its revenue and could lead to further tailwinds in the future.
Baron Funds mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:
“Broadcom Inc. is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The stock rose during the quarter as it reported strong earnings on the back of its two key growth drivers, AI semiconductors and its acquired VMware software business. The company once again increased its outlook for AI-related revenue, now expecting $11 billion or more this year (versus prior guidance for $10 billion), on the back of strength in both hyperscale custom compute and networking chips, where Broadcom maintains dominating share. In networking, Broadcom’s solutions are critical to enabling AI training factories to scale towards 100,000 chip clusters in the near term and 1 million chip clusters over the coming years. In AI custom compute, Broadcom designs custom accelerators for large consumer- internet AI companies (such as Google and Meta), who are building increasingly large AI clusters to drive improvements in user engagement and targeted advertising on their consumer media platforms. VMware remains on track to continue rapid sequential growth while simultaneously reducing operating expenses, driving faster-than-expected margin expansion and accretion, as management has simplified the product offering and is converting customers from a license model to subscriptions. We believe VMware will grow beyond the $4 billion near-term quarterly target, well above current analyst expectations. These two factors combined have caused a re-rating to the growth profile for the overall company. To quote CEO Hock Tan, “there is only one Broadcom. Period.”
Overall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of UBS’ top quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241115,AVGO,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher.
Ken Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory.
Under Fisher’s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times’ list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis
Understanding Bull Markets and the Role of Technology in Investment Strategies
Ken Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm’s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic.
Fisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns.
Ken Fisher Predicts Shift as Value Stocks Begin to Outperform Growth Amid Fed Rate Speculations
Ken Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks.
Story Continues
“As 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn’t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that’s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.”
Additionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources.
As short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 130
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a leader in semiconductor and infrastructure software, delivers high-performance chips and software solutions for the tech and telecom sectors. In Q3 2024, Broadcom outperformed revenue expectations with $13.07 billion, exceeding forecasts by $108.35 million, and achieved a normalized EPS of $1.24, beating estimates by $0.03.
Despite a GAAP EPS loss of $0.40, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s upcoming earnings announcement on December 6, 2024, has analysts projecting strong performance, with a forecasted normalized EPS of $1.39 and revenue reaching $14.09 billion. Over the past 90 days, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has recorded 20 upward EPS revisions, highlighting analyst confidence in its growth trajectory.
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanding market for AI technologies. With rising demand for high-performance computing, Broadcom’s semiconductor products are expected to play a significant role in powering AI applications, driving further revenue growth. Additionally, Broadcom’s strong partnerships with major technology companies strengthen its foundation for sustained success.
Parnassus Value Equity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“During the second quarter, the Fund’s overweight position in the Information Technology sector decreased slightly as we sold our position in Cisco Systems and used most of the proceeds to buy Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a leading semiconductor company and provider of custom silicon products. Both stocks provide similar exposure to networking technology, but we believe Broadcom offers more upside from AI infrastructure spend and defensiveness due to its software assets.
Overall, AVGO ranks 9th on our list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Is Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?
On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.
Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.
McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.
McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.”
On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.
Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.
He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.
Story Continues
As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.

Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Stock to Buy and Hold for 5 Years?
High angle view of a semiconductor chip against an array of electronics components.
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 130
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.
The company has been performing exceptionally throughout the year, having launched breakthrough technologies that facilitate the management of large datasets for AI tasks and scalable AI systems. Fast forward to November 5th, the company unveiled VeloRAIN, a platform that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the performance of AI security workloads. On the same day, the company’s VMware Cloud Foundation unveiled a private cloud platform to improve customers’ AI autonomy and security.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially to $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion, driven by ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers. Overall, consolidated revenue and net income grew by 47% and 44%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024, driven by growing AI revenue and VMware bookings.
Broadcom Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as it leverages artificial intelligence. In addition to that, company officials believe AVGO is finally achieving stability on a company-wide level and is on track to becoming an AI powerhouse.
ClearBridge Investments’ ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.”
Overall, AVGO ranks 5th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.
See our latest analysis for Broadcom
The Calculation
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

Story Continues
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$56b× (1 + 2.6%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.6%) = US$1.0t
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.0t÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$460b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$753b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$184, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

Important Assumptions
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Broadcom as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.378. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
SWOT Analysis for Broadcom
Strength
Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.
Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.
Good value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.
Threat
Dividends are not covered by earnings.
Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.
Next Steps:
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Broadcom, there are three important factors you should assess:

20241115,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.
Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday’s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there’s a catch.
“What if the Treasury doesn’t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.”
READ ALSO Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks and Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins
Even though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.
Cramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump’s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board—on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains—no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it’s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:
“If it’s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses… It has always worked for the stock market.”
But Cramer warned that there’s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market’s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.
Story Continues
“If you believe we’re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.”

How ServiceNow Inc (NOW)’s AI Partnerships Are Driving Its Soaring Growth: Insights from Jim Cramer
A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.
ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)
Talking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:
“As is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn’t make a lot of sense and… we’re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company’s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia’s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.
This partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.
For the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%. The company also expects a gross profit margin of 84.5% for its subscription services, with an operating income margin of 29.5% and a free cash flow margin of 31%.
Overall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241115,NOW,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL –November 15, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Toast TOST, as the Bull of the Day and Clean Harbors CLH, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Toast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.
The stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock’s ongoing upward momentum.
About the Company
Toast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.
With its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.

The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “A” in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a “F” in Value.
Q3 Earnings Beat
On November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.
Q3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.
The company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.
Gross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.

“Toast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.”
Estimates Headed Higher
Analysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.
Story Continues
For the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.
For the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.
For the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.
Toast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote
With the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.
JPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.
The Technical Take
The stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO’d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.
After trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.
With the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.
Post earnings low: $36
Gap fill: $33
21-day: $32
50-day: $29.20
200-day: $25.20
Fibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32
While that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.
In Summary
Toast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.
The company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.
As Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.
Bear of the Day:
Clean Harbors  is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.
The company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?
With an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.
About the Company
Clean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).
The company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world’s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.
CLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “D” in Value, But “B” in both Momentum and Growth.
Q3 Earnings
The company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.
Despite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.
Positive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.
While there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.
Earnings Estimates
Estimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.
For the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.
Looking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.
For the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year’s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.
Technical Take
The drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.
This volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.
The drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.
The stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.
In Summary
Clean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.
With significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.

Strong Portfolio Aids NOW’s Prospects
ServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW’s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.
ServiceNow’s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.

Strong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive
A strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.
NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.
The strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.
In third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.
NOW’s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation
However, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.
In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector’s 6.37X.
We believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow’s premium valuation.
Conclusion
ServiceNow’s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.
ServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241115,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.
Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ to discuss the market’s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we’ve had some ""very good"" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.

Hickey’s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.
Developments in the AI Landscape
With AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn’t anyone who doesn’t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the “Future 40”. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.
Artificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure”, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China’s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act “as ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.”

As per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden’s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments “to give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure”, amongst other things.

20241115,NOW,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
ServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
Story Continues
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Should You Invest in NOW?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

20241115,NOW,"Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
ServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.
Insiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).
ServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock
The last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.
Insider Ownership Of ServiceNow
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?
Insiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for ServiceNow you should be aware of.

20241115,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.
One conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC’s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.

Nevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity’s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn’t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.
While that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.
“The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever”.
In light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called ""time testing compute"" for improving models during the “inference” phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.
Recent AI Developments
Fortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry’s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.
Story Continues
In its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn’t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot’s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.
In other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.
“Ad programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.”

In a recent program, Jim Cramer celebrated the market’s rally on Donald Trump’s election victory, saying the market likes Trump.
“The market likes Donald J. Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?”
Cramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.
“Trump wants to cut taxes—all taxes—including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It’s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that’s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.”
Cramer said the market is still “oversold” as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground. However, Cramer said the polls were again proved wrong.
Cramer then talked about the stocks that investors can buy to ride the Trump rally.

20241115,NOW,"ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.

Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
ServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

20241115,NOW,"ServiceNow Customer Service Management and Five9 Intelligent CX Platform to streamline self-service and assisted service operations
Integrated solution to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction
TORONTO & BARCELONA, Spain, November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow World Forum & Five9 CX Summit—ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, and Five9 (NASDAQ: FIVN), provider of the Intelligent CX Platform, today announced an expanded partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified end-to-end employee and customer experiences. By combining the strengths of ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) and the Five9 platform, the solution will create more streamlined self-service and assisted service operations and unify customer support processes to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and simplify contact center operations.
""Organizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together,"" said John Ball, senior vice president, Customer and Industry Workflows at ServiceNow. ""ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self-service and assisted service across voice and digital channels. Our expanded partnership with Five9 takes this even further, combining the best of both platforms to streamline and unify contact center operations with a turnkey solution that’s fast to deploy and delivers fast ROI.""
""Five9’s longstanding partnership with ServiceNow has been rooted in the joint mission to create seamless and powerful end-to-end customer experiences,"" said Callan Schebella, executive vice president, product management, Five9. ""This next phase of our partnership transforms the approach to customer experience management, alleviating a lot of the frustrations that come with using multiple systems to address customer needs. We’ve taken a big step forward to empower customers with our joint AI capabilities and improved interface functionality, easing the day-to-day challenges of customer-facing service.""
""Combining the most valuable features into a unified interface can transform the way we support our customers,"" said Bob Massengill, senior director, Technology Infrastructure, Pilot Travel Centers, LLC. ""This new ServiceNow-Five9 joint solution has the potential to enable us to address customer needs more quickly and effectively.""
Story Continues
The new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.
Real-time Transcription – Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents’ work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.
Unified Routing – Five9’s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9. This reduces operational overhead for managers through streamlined routing management across both systems, making it easier to adjust staffing during high-demand periods. It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.
Single Agent Experience – Native Call Controls within ServiceNow’s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer’s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.
Availability
The ServiceNow and Five9 integrated capabilities are expected to be available to select customers in the first half of 2025.

New Now Assist capabilities drive greater visibility and controls with AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices
Native multilingual support extends global footprint for seamless, culturally aware GenAI communications and translations
Purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety
SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, today announced new generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to advance autonomous, responsible AI on the Now Platform. With this launch, ServiceNow is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio for customers. This includes new, expanded Now Assist capabilities that drive greater visibility and controls with an AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices. Native multilingual support in Now Assist extends GenAI’s global footprint for seamless, culturally aware communications and translations. Finally, purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety.
As enterprises have accelerated the adoption of GenAI, they are discovering that siloed applications and scattered data are barriers to impact and that establishing clearly defined, human-centric governance processes are essential to the effective use and oversight of GenAI. That’s why ServiceNow delivers a winning combination of one platform with an integrated data layer and continues to optimize its AI platform for speed, scale, and security. The single architecture of the Now Platform helps ensure strong governance is embedded in its Now Assist GenAI solutions, models, and agents no matter where they are deployed in an organization.
""Enterprises across every industry are embracing a future of greater autonomy and productivity, all in service to their employees, customers, and overall business impact,"" said Jon Sigler, senior vice president of Platform and AI at ServiceNow. ""The ServiceNow platform was built to empower this transformation, offering smarter, faster ways of working through AI-enabled automation. With governance at the core, these new innovations bring more personalized, collaborative, trusted experiences to life across the enterprise.""
Elevating customer trust with integrated AI governance
Teams working with AI are often burdened with siloed tools and systems, making visibility and AI governance difficult. AI governance requires the integration of complex business processes and needs a best-of-breed workflow platform to be implemented successfully. With a unified AI inventory data model for connecting AI strategy, technology, security, and compliance to operate as an AI control tower, and expanded oversight for AI Governance for Now Assist, ServiceNow is laying a foundation to help customers build trust while accelerating business transformation.
Story Continues
ServiceNow also introduced new Now Assist capabilities that empower customers with the tools needed for responsible AI use:
Now Assist Guardian provides built-in monitoring and responsible AI guardrails so customers can better control the use of GenAI on the Now Platform. This includes the management and mitigation of offensive content, security vulnerabilities, and the exposure of sensitive information.
Now Assist Data Kit eases the often-cumbersome task of managing and consuming data for AI use cases. Users can create and easily manage datasets for AI skills and applications, develop ground truth datasets to benchmark for accuracy and help predict AI outcomes, and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of experiences built with Now Assist Skill Kit.
Now Assist Analytics offers greater visibility into the adoption, usage, and performance of Now Assist across the enterprise. With these insights, customers can make more informed, data-driven decisions to advance GenAI adoption, evaluate ROI on GenAI investments, and enable better business outcomes.
Extending the value and impact of GenAI globally
With today’s launch, ServiceNow is adding new built-in multilingual features to Now Assist. These new features address customer demand and expand the application of ServiceNow’s GenAI solutions in global markets. Now Assist can now generate, summarize, and respond to GenAI prompts in the user’s native language, providing improved, culturally aware understanding and communication for both agents and requestors.
The following languages are supported natively by Now Assist: English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese. Other languages will continue to be supported with ServiceNow’s existing Dynamic Translation, which automatically translates user inputs and a response back in the user’s language.
Accelerating productivity with tailored Now Assist solutions
Building on the Xanadu platform release—which marked the company’s most comprehensive set of AI innovations to date—ServiceNow has further expanded Now Assist solutions, purpose-built for specific enterprise use cases. From configuration management to legal affairs and health and safety, GenAI can help transform the productivity and efficacy of these critical internal functions.
Now Assist for Configuration Management Database (CMDB) uses AI to make managing and understanding data easier for customers. It helps users keep a clean and accurate CMDB by reducing duplicate data, simplifying complex information, and streamlining data input. With Now Assist for CMDB, users can quickly view summaries of Configuration Items (CIs) and their dependencies, and AI can find and fix duplicate data automatically. It also assists in the setup of Service Graph Connectors to bring data into the CMDB and fix any issues that come up during the process.
Now Assist for Legal Service Delivery helps legal teams deliver faster service to clients with auto-generated summaries of legal requests and matters. Legal teams are often juggling multiple requests and complex legal matters, such as investigations, simultaneously. With Now Assist, they can fulfill these requests with greater efficiency and faster time to resolution.
Now Assist in Contract Management streamlines contract processing and reduces risk by leveraging GenAI to automatically flag non-standard language, identify missing clauses and suggest revisions within contracts such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Additionally, GenAI provides rapid insights into contractual terms and obligations by intelligently extracting metadata from contracts. This helps reduce cost, revenue leakage, and risk for the enterprise.
Now Assist for Health and Safety helps ensure a safer environment for employees by streamlining incident management processes while reducing manual, repetitive work for health and safety workers. It uses GenAI to auto-generate summaries of safety incidents and lessons learned based on incident records, resulting in more effective communication, improved agent productivity, and proactive prevention and resolution of incidents.
In addition to these new innovations, ServiceNow Impact—the ServiceNow customer success solution to maximize AI, optimize performance, provide on-demand expertise, and accelerate business value—includes new GenAI accelerators to help make adoption of Now Assist solutions easier and faster for customers.
""Worldwide spending on AI is projected to grow 3 times greater than the five-year CAGR for worldwide IT spending over the same period (2023-2028), driven by the rapid infusion of AI and GenAI for employee experience, customer engagement, business processes, and industry innovation,"" said Ritu Jyoti, general manager/group VP, AI, and Data market research and advisory at IDC. ""As organizations look to drive value from AI transformations, they recognize the need for a single and scalable platform that connects people, processes, data, and systems. ServiceNow is meeting customers where they are by streamlining workflows and simplifying complex processes on a single AI-powered platform. As ServiceNow expands GenAI into new areas of the enterprise, the company continues to help organizations transform operations and stay competitive.""
Customers like EY are already seeing the benefits of Now Assist.
""GenAI is having a huge impact on our organization, both in the way EY teams deliver EY services and support EY people, but also in creating opportunities to go to market with ServiceNow to help EY clients transform their businesses,"" said Hank Prybylski, Global Vice Chair, Transformation, EY. ""We are seeing incredible value in the Now Assist space and looking to extend that to a whole suite of areas including customer service management and more broadly to our managed services environment.""
Putting data and AI to work across the Now Platform
On top of today’s launch, ServiceNow recently announced Workflow Data Fabric, a breakthrough innovation that enhances all ServiceNow workflows, AI solutions, and AI Agents.
This enhanced, integrated data layer allows customers to connect, understand, and act on structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data across the enterprise, inside and outside of ServiceNow. Coupled with zero copy capabilities and the future integration of Knowledge Graph, which transforms raw data into contextual insights, ServiceNow is unifying people, processes, operations, and systems so AI can work more autonomously across the enterprise.
These data capabilities are an instrumental part of ServiceNow's vision of AI Agents that work autonomously and collaboratively with people to enable business transformation. This vision also includes the expansion of its partnership with NVIDIA to jointly develop AI agent use cases on the Now Platform and accelerate the adoption of Agentic AI, reinventing how AI delivers value across all industries.
Availability
AI Governance for Now Assist is available today to a limited set of customers and is expected to be generally available in Q1 2025. All other new GenAI innovations announced today are now generally available to customers in the ServiceNow Store.

20241115,NOW,"Investing.com - Cloud software providers are expected to see a recovery in customer spending as a resilient economic environment pushes more businesses to invest in their artificial intelligence-powered technologies, according to analysts at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and peer Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) have also been pouring money into building out their own AI capabilities and folding them into their products, although investors have raised concerns around the timeline for the pay off from these expenditures.
In a note to clients, the Wells Fargo analysts led by Michael Turrin argued that ServiceNow is among the few software comapnies ""demonstrating tangible AI monetization,"" adding they expect the group to ""play offense"" in AI customer service. Businesses use ServiceNow's AI-backed products to automate and manage their IT processes and reduce costs.
Last month, ServiceNow unveiled a fourth-quarter subscription revenue forecast that topped Wall Street expectations.
The firm, which has been rolling out new AI-enhanced offerings to its enterprise clients such as ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and video conferencing service Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), also increased its full-year subscription revenue outlook thanks to solid demand from new and existing customers.
Meanwhile, ServiceNow's rival Salesforce has yet to show enough evidence its own AI offering will be enough to return growth to double-digits in the near term, the Wells Fargo analysts said.
In August, the software-as-a-service pioneer reported better-than-anticipated revenue of $9.33 billion in its second quarter and raised its annual profit outlook to a range of $10.03 to $10.11 per share, up from $9.86 to $9.94. But Salesforce's guidance for third-quarter revenue still missed expectations, exacerbating worries around a potential rebound in cloud spending.
The Wells Fargo analysts said they see more ""attractive opportunities"" in companies like ServiceNow that have already shown an ability to make money off of so-called generative AI. The setup for Salesforce heading into next is ""tough,"" they added.

20241115,NOW,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.
That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.
However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.
ServiceNow (NOW) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations a great growth pick right now.
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 6.7%.
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13.4%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.
Story Continues
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
The current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.2% over the past month.
Bottom Line
ServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

Technology is a Big Deal, Strategist Highlights
The Magnificent Seven continues to grasp a sizeable market share of the market gains over the past few years. That said, investors and analysts are excited to see what this earnings period has to offer for the magnificent seven and how much of an influence they have on the market. On October 31, Christian Dery, head of macro strategy at Capital Fund Management, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the impact of the magnificent seven on the market.
Dery suggested that these companies have grown to become large entities and their market capitalization often fluctuates by $2 billion to $400 billion on earnings events. Looking at the dispersion of the index, Dery adds that individual stocks within the S&P are very diverse and more independent, hinting towards a very low correlation in the index.
He adds that generative AI and LLMs are very different from the traditional software business. Therefore, the hyperscaling model that is conventionally taken from software can not be applied here. For every new customer in the software business, the marginal cost often goes down to nearly zero. However, if you look at the “tech incumbents”, they have to increase their capital expenditures to develop compute clusters and scale their operations, suggests Dery.
In 2023, the chips industry generated revenue of about $3 billion, reflecting that we are yet to find a killer use case or see results of generous AI spending. Dery adds that the market is more likely to be “discerning” on the path to profitability since companies are going to focus more on capital expenditures and projections for capital expenditures. He is particularly interested in the CapEx projections of the Magnificent Seven and shares that if they miss there could be a negative reaction among those stocks.
Dery reiterated that the market is yet to see the investments pay off multiple times but maintains his interest in capital expenditures by these companies playing out. While he is bullish on technological innovation and believes artificial intelligence is disruptive and a “big deal”, he fails to see viable results as of now. Dery also emphasizes that these companies are directing their investments to AI because they do not want to fall behind competitors, with no proper timeline for AI monetization.

20241120,META,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.
By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.
However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.
Our proprietary system currently recommends Meta Platforms (META) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this social media company a great growth pick right now.
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 51.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 32.2%.
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.
Right now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.57, it can be said that the company is more efficient.
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 20.8% this year versus the industry average of 7.1%.
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Story Continues
There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.1% over the past month.
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

FT claims that Alibaba, ByteDance and Meituan are three Chinese firms that have been expanding their offices in California in recent months.

20241120,META,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Meta Platforms (META) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
Meta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 52 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 52 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 82.7% and 3.9% of all recommendations.

While the ABR calls for buying Meta Platforms, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR
In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.
Story Continues
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Is META Worth Investing In?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.1% over the past month to $22.53.
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.

20241120,META,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Numenta, a company with backing from the Gates Foundation, on Wednesday released an open-source AI model it hopes will require less energy and data to create intelligent machines than existing technologies.
Numenta was co-founded by Jeff Hawkins, the founder of Palm Computing in the 1990s, which in turn invented the Palm Pilot. Hawkins' deepest academic interest is neuroscience, which showed up in the Palm Pilot's handwriting recognition software that leveraged an earlier era of artificial intelligence.
While most of today's popular AI systems are roughly modeled on human brains with a technology called neural networks, Numenta has a different idea of how the brain works and hopes to persuade AI researchers to try its approach.
Most current AI systems ingest huge amounts of static data - such as massive libraries of text or images - and run that through thousands or even tens of thousands of computing chips. After weeks or months of computing using vast amounts of electricity, the AI system is trained to generate responses to human queries.
Numenta believes that such training can be a more constant process, where brain cells gather small bits of information from senses such as sight and touch and constantly develop models of the world that can be modified on the fly as conditions change, like a young child learning a new toy.
The company says the approach can be applied to robots that learn to navigate the world and other types of knowledge like writing. On Wednesday, it will release open source computer code to let other companies and researchers try its approach.
Other firms such as Meta Platforms have also made their AI technology freely available. That has helped Meta catch up to rivals such as OpenAI, but has also led to the use of Meta's technology by the Chinese military.
Subutai Ahmad, Numenta's chief executive, said the company will closely monitor how its technology is used once it becomes public.
""The technology is still early, and the way we deal with this will depend on the exact way the technology matures,"" Ahmad told Reuters. ""These are important issues that we need to think about.""

20241120,META,"Palmer Luckey, the founder of the $14 billion AI-powered weapons startup Anduril, has become the face of change in the defense industry. And with his mullet, uneven goatee, and Hawaiian shirts, it’s not the face you might expect in the generally buttoned-up sector.
Unlike most polished, suited, and scripted defense executives, Luckey comes across as brutally honest and undeniably weird. In language that’s sometimes vulgar, he discusses his high-profile termination from Facebook; gleefully explains his various rivalries; and readily takes on questions that might make the average executive squirm.
So it’s almost surprising to hear Luckey admit how much he cares about how the world perceives him. “I’m going to keep making things for the rest of my career,” he says in a candid interview with Fortune. “In order for me to do things, I need to convince people to work with me.”
Having created—as a teenager—the revolutionary Oculus gaming headset, sold it to Facebook (now called Meta) for $2 billion in 2014, then endured an embarrassing public ousting from the company he built, Luckey now runs the nation’s largest private defense startup. And the longtime supporter of Donald Trump is poised to become exponentially more powerful in the next few years.
Luckey and I spoke about a week before the U.S. election, via Zoom from a Miami hotel room, before he headed to a conference. In a week, Trump would storm to victory. Luckey is sitting pretty with well over $1 billion in military contracts and a fleet of Anduril’s weapons being used in the Russia-Ukraine war.
Luckey’s long-standing support of Trump—since at least 2011, when he has said he wrote to Trump and asked him to run for office, and through this year’s election cycle, during which he donated $400,000 to Trump’s campaign, according to filings means he may have the ear of the most powerful man in the world.
What does he want to do now? Work on a new headset project.
Luckey says that he has envisioned applying Anduril’s AI-powered 3D battlefield-mapping platform Lattice to this kind of hardware from the beginning of the company, and that it was one of the ideas in the original 2017 pitch deck for investors.
Anduril founder Palmer Luckey photographed at Anduril's factory in Santa Ana, California on Nov. 6, 2024. Maggie Shannon for Fortune
“I wanted to prove that I wasn’t a one-hit wonder,” says Luckey, now 32. “That I was still somebody.""
But Luckey’s investors were wary of the gaming-headset tycoon’s motives, he recalls. They initially thought “it would turn into a pissing contest with Facebook” and encouraged him to go in another direction and focus “on what you think is the most important for the country—not most important for your ego.” Luckey took the advice and focused on other projects, like autonomous surveillance towers that are used at the U.S. borders, and drones that have been deployed in Ukraine.
Story Continues
Meanwhile, Microsoft had been developing its HoloLens headsets for the U.S. Army since 2018. Anduril announced in September that it had come on board to improve the combat goggles’ performance, in a deal with the Pentagon that may generate as much as $21.9 billion for the two companies over the next decade. Lattice pulls various sensory data to create a 3D battlefield map in the headset, to help soldiers see how to safely get from one point to another or distinguish allies from enemies on the battlefield.
Other attempts to incorporate headset hardware into military applications over the years haven’t worked out. The Army’s Nett Warrior system, for example, abandoned headset plans over a decade ago, pivoting to a smartphone. Luckey says the problem is that the data flowing into the devices— like 2D maps—isn’t useful enough, and he asserts that Anduril’s Lattice system, which pulls data from satellite feeds, drones, and infrared imaging units, will change that.
“I don’t care if people think that I’m nice or cool or fashionable. But I do care that they think that I am moral. I do care if they think that I am a reliable partner who is not going to stab them in the back.”
After his ordeal with the Oculus, it’s clear that Luckey is delighted to be back in the headset business. He was terminated by Facebook in 2017 after a donation he made to a pro-Trump group led to speculation that he was associated with members who had made racist comments online. Amid the backlash, Luckey issued an apology. But he now regrets allowing other people to “dictate my press strategy” and persuade him not to push back against news coverage he says was “completely fabricated.”
Seven years later, Luckey says the ordeal has deeply influenced his approach to business and people. He admits he is always asking himself how things could go wrong: “What is the worst situation I could end up in with this person or this company? If this goes south, what is the worst thing that could happen to me?” And he generally goes into conversations thinking, “This person is gonna try to f--k me.”
In his new line of work, this approach “has worked out pretty well,” he says. Anduril has become the leader of a new pack of tech companies that is challenging the sector’s longtime incumbents, such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, by using private capital to innovate, rather than waiting on funding from government contracts to develop new technologies. Anduril inked a nearly $1 billion contract in 2022 with U.S. Special Operations Command for counter drones and, earlier this year, a $250 million Department of Defense contract for one of its interceptor systems. It works closely with the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.K. Ministry of Defense, and the Australian Defense Force. (Anduril’s drones have been used in Ukraine, but its technology has not been used in Gaza, Luckey said.) A 5-million-square-foot manufacturing facility in an undisclosed location is in the works. And Anduril continues to come out with new products—most recently a family of combat drones called Bolt.

A veteran of the intelligence software startup Palantir, Brian Schimpf cofounded Anduril and serves as CEO, but it’s Luckey who is the most well-known of its executives and often serves as the public face of the company, doing what he calls “propagandizing” at conferences and in the media.
Luckey acknowledges that part of what he’s propagandizing for is his own reputation. “I realized too late that my reputation is actually very important,” he says. “I cannot accomplish anything of significance if I don’t care what people think of me…And that is what I’m most terrified of at this point.” He does it in his own bombastic way, of course: He will debate critics of Anduril drones on X, hurling crass insults such as “r----d” at them (and others).
Luckey rejects, however, the notion that he is a bigot. In the aftermath of his defenestration from Facebook, Luckey recalls, “I allowed people to believe things that were totally false. And if they believe that I’m an anti-Semitic, hateful, racist person who’s paying people to harass people on the internet, of course they don’t want to work with me.
“I don’t care if people think that I’m nice or cool or fashionable,” he explains. “But I do care that they think that I am moral. I do care if they think that I am a reliable partner who is not going to stab them in the back. I do want people to understand that I am loyal to the people who share common cause with me, and that I will not turn on them. And as long as I can convince enough people of that, I don’t really mind the rest.

20241120,META,"We recently compiled a list of the Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.
When it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there’s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University’s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).
Founded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university’s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard’s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard’s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university’s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard’s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.
According to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia’s 11.5% or Brown’s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC’s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:
“In FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC’s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.”
Notably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from ""overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500."" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar’s strategy of overhauling the university’s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.

The advent of artificial intelligence has shaken up the Search business on the internet, a domain where Google has long reigned supreme. With AI models from startups like OpenAI, companies are offering natural language search capabilities to users that are cutting away Google's dominance in the Search market. Latest reports from news publication Bloomberg suggest that Google now faces added pressure with authorities in the US reportedly pushing the firm to spin off its Chrome browser business. The report further claims that authorities are also planning to recommend to a federal judge that Google face antitrust requirements related to AI and its Android mobile operating system.

The measures are a byproduct of a multilayer case that the Justice Department has built against Google. The government won the first round in the case earlier this year, which sought to prove that the tech giant has a web search monopoly in the US. In the ruling on this case, federal judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets. Per the Justice Department, the case against Chrome stems from the fact that the browser is a key access point through which many people use Google Search. Chrome controls about 61% of the browser market in the US, according to web traffic service StatCounter.

20241120,META,"Instagram’s recommendations don’t always hit the target. Sometimes the social media site pushes posts to your feed that reflect something you’ve long since lost interest in. Other times, it just guesses wrong. Now Instagram is in the process of offering a “reset” button to give your feed a fresh start.
Meta says it’s testing a way for people to get a clean slate in their Explore, Reels, and Feed. The feature is still being tested, but the company said it “will soon roll out globally.”
Resetting will also allow users to review the accounts they are following and unfollow any that share content they no longer want to see. The new tool will not delete your data from the app or change how the company serves ads.
Resetting suggestions on your feed is something most users might appreciate, but Meta is saying this change is a way to make the app safer for teen users.
“We want to make sure everyone on Instagram—especially teens—has safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences and feels the time they’re spending on Instagram is valuable,” the company wrote in a blog post. “We want to give teens new ways to shape their Instagram experience, so it can continue to reflect their passions and interests as they evolve.”
Instagram has been on the defensive about how it handles young users since a whistleblower leaked internal documents suggesting Facebook knowingly prioritized profit over well-being and safety. The controversy led to congressional testimony and spurred debate about what could be done to protect minors online. In October 2023, more than 30 U.S. states filed a lawsuit against Meta alleging harmful youth marketing.
Two months ago, the company unveiled a new type of Instagram account for anyone under 16, with significantly more parental supervision tools. Current Instagram users who fall in the age range were automatically placed into the teen accounts as well.

AI technology has forced businesses worldwide to reconsider their money making models. This revolutionary change is now making its way into the government sector as well. According to a report from news agency Reuters, Mothibi Ramusi, the chief of the communications regulator in South Africa, recently said that the information and communications technology sector needs policy and regulatory changes to keep up with emerging technologies. The country is also debating new regulations for mobile virtual networks and spectrum sharing.

The latter claims that traditional telco networks are built to handle peak loads and usually use only about one-third of their capacity. With AI-RAN, a new communications tech, they can expect to monetize the remaining two-thirds of the capacity for AI inference services.

20241120,AAPL,"Qualcomm stock (QCOM) fell as much as 6% on Wednesday, a day after the company provided new financial targets for its non-smartphone business at its first investor day in three years.
Qualcomm, which gets the majority of its revenue from designing and licensing handset chips, has been expanding into semiconductors that go into cars, personal computers, and other devices.
The company now expects those businesses to generate a combined $22 billion in sales by 2029.
Sales of $8 billion will come from Qualcomm’s automotive segment, where it already has partnerships with the likes of BMW to increase computing functionality in vehicles and push toward more autonomous driving.
Qualcomm forecast that $14 billion will come from its Internet of Things segment, which includes extended reality devices and industrial functions. It also includes PCs, expected to account for $4 billion. The company’s Snapdragon X Elite chips power Microsoft’s latest-generation Surface laptops, which feature the GenAI Copilot assistant.

“Everybody that buys an X Elite is extremely happy with it,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in an interview following the investor day in New York. “From all of our OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and Microsoft, the current response is exceeding everybody's expectation.”
Amon called the $4 billion target for the PC business “high confidence.”
Some analysts, however, said the road there may not be smooth.
“While management is optimistic about AI PC opportunities, Windows-on-ARM skepticism and intense competition (from both x86 and ARM SoC suppliers) could limit QCOM’s opportunity,” Raymond James’ Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to clients. He has a Hold-equivalent Market Perform rating on the stock.
Bank of America’s Tal Liani rates Qualcomm a Buy and “came away incrementally positive on Qualcomm’s long-term positioning and the diversification outside of handsets.”
But Liani pointed out that not only is the company entering markets with emerging tech, but it also needs to grab market share.
""These markets need to develop to support Qualcomm's long-term targets, of which the pace and magnitude [are] uncertain,"" he wrote.

Qualcomm’s biggest business remains smartphones, and its ramped-up diversification comes as Apple (AAPL) is working on migrating away from Qualcomm modems. As for the Android-based business, Amon said he’s projecting mid-single-digit growth, what he calls a “conservative assumption.”
That means the company expects to end the decade with revenue about evenly split between handsets at 50% and autos and Internet of Things combined at the other 50%.

“The narrative of solid earnings power even ex-AAPL seems alive, and in general the assumptions don’t appear to require any huge stretches,” wrote Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon, who has an Outperform recommendation on Qualcomm shares.
Qualcomm shares have lagged this year amid that expected Apple transition, rising just under 7% compared with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s (^SOX) 16% gain.
So what about artificial intelligence? Amon expects the adoption of smartphones with more AI capabilities to be an unpredictable process but one that’s ultimately beneficial for Qualcomm.
“It is hard to make a prediction because, at the end of the day, it's all based on what developers are going to come up with,” he said in the interview.
""I can go back to the conversation between feature phones and smartphones and BlackBerrys, and smartphones started with 10 apps, then a hundred apps, then thousands of apps, and then you start to see the big switch,"" he added. ""And I feel the same way about AI use cases. I can't really tell you it's going to be this year or next year. I can tell you within five years I think we are going to have all using an AI smartphone. Anything that happens faster, it's going to be an upgrade cycle that we're going to benefit tremendously.”

20241120,AAPL,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will seek a federal judge on Wednesday to throw out a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust case claiming the firm illegally controls the smartphone market, thus limiting competition and interoperability with outside apps and devices.
U.S. District Judge Julien Neals will hear arguments at Newark, New Jersey. Apple argues that its policies are reasonable and need to promote innovation; prosecutors contend Apple locks consumers into its ecosystem and inhibits rivals. Filed in March by the Department of Justice and a group of states, the lawsuit questions Apple's policies on app developers, fees, and limits on rival third-party products and services including smartwatches and digital wallets.
Apple has cited earlier decisions in same circumstances, including the dismissal of the Federal Trade Commission's charges against Meta Platforms (META) and elements of the antitrust case against Google, contending that denial of access to technology shouldn't be judged anticompetitive.
The case shows a more general bipartisan interest in Big Tech antitrust enforcement. Other examples include Google's search monopoly, Meta's acquisitions of rivals, and Amazon's (AMZN) seller restrictions. Apple's demand for dismissal marks the most recent challenge in the continuous investigation of computer behemoths.

Except for Huawei, Counterpoint Research ascribed the market dynamics to early releases of flagship models by key Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These introductions hampered previous versions' sales but boosted younger models.

This piece has been updated by the editor to make corrections on Warren’s current Apple holdings.
Warren Buffett's investment strategy is a case study in bold and safe play. Nearly $99 billion is pegged on two iconic names: Apple and Coca-Cola. Through Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has reduced his Apple stake significantly in 2024, trimming it by about two-thirds.
Berkshire now holds approximately 300 million shares of Apple stock, valued at $69.9 billion as of September, down from 905 million shares at the end of 2023. Despite this, Apple remains Berkshire’s largest equity position, accounting for 28% of the portfolio, as cited by CNBC.

This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before it closes in a few days
His strategy here is simple but powerful – backing companies with brand strength and consistent financials. Apple's stock, for instance, surged 31% this year and many see this as Buffett's savviest move yet. Some say it's his ""crown jewel,"" lauding his foresight in spotting a tech company that's proven as resilient as it is profitable.
But as with any big bet, Buffett's heavy reliance on Apple has sparked some chatter. Skeptics say putting so many eggs in one tech basket could be risky. With tech stocks, there's always the threat of shifting consumer trends, not to mention the occasional market shake-up.
Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.
And while Apple has shown impressive gains this year, the latest numbers hint at a slight cooling. In the last fiscal year, Apple's total revenue dipped by 0.8% – a small shift but enough to raise eyebrows. According to Business Insider, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring believes Apple has room to climb, setting a price target of $273 from the current $216.
Apple's pivot toward services is holding it steady. Though iPhone sales may ebb and flow, Apple's revenues from the App Store, streaming and cloud services have grown by 23% over the past few years.
Services have also helped Apple boost its profit margins, going from 43.3% in 2022 to 46.2% in 2024, catching Wall Street's attention. These margins and the cash flow from services make Apple's high share prices easier to swallow, especially as it could mean bigger dividends for shareholders.

Trending: With over 7.8K investors including Meta, Google, And Amazon Execs — this AI Startup's valuation has skyrocketed from $5 million to $85 million in just three years. Be an early investor with just $1,000 for only $0.50/share today before the offer closes in the next few days!
Then there's Coca-Cola, which stands out as Buffett's textbook choice. It's familiar, steady and beloved worldwide. His initial investment in Coca-Cola in the late ‘80s has since grown to a $27.67 billion stake and despite recent bumps – like a 12% drop from September's peak – investors still see value here.
Morgan Stanley's Dara Mohsenian predicts Coca-Cola could climb to $76 a share, marking a potential 19% increase. Investors love Coca-Cola for its dependable growth and steady dividend payouts. Coca-Cola just raised its dividend for the 62nd consecutive year, offering a 3% yield – a rarity in today's market.
Unlike the roller-coaster nature of tech, Coca-Cola's simpler, time-tested business model gives it a stability that's hard to beat. The company's revenue ticked up, with a 5.0% rise in the first nine months of 2024 alone and management projects 10% organic sales growth for the year – proof of the brand's staying power.

20241120,AAPL,"'It Changed My Life': Tim Cook, Mark Cuban And Bill Gates Reveal Their Top AI Productivity Hacks
Leading tech executives are talking about how artificial intelligence tools have transformed their daily productivity routines, revealing the practical applications of AI tech for business efficiency.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said he's seen improvements in email management through AI summarization tools. Previously reading an inbox of 800 daily emails, Cook told the Wall Street Journal last month that he now uses Apple Intelligence’s summary feature to streamline his morning routine.

“It’s changed my life. It really has,” Cook said. “If I can save time here and there, it adds up to something significant across a day, a week, a month.”
Mark Cuban, who similarly deals with thousands of daily emails, is using Google’s Gemini AI assistant to automate routine responses. “It’s reduced the need for me to write out routine replies,” Cuban said to CNBC. “I can spend 30 seconds evaluating its response and hit ‘send’ versus typing it all out myself.”

Bill Gates has embraced AI for meeting documentation. Despite his preference for handwritten notes, Gates now relies on AI transcription and summary features integrated into Microsoft Teams. “The ability to interact and not just get the summary, but ask questions about the meeting, is pretty fantastic,” Gates told The Verge.

His adoption reflects broader industry acceptance, with Gartner reporting that 75% of CEOs across industries have experimented with AI tools and 87% believe the benefits outweigh potential risks.

For Cook, AI integration is more than convenience. He places Apple Intelligence among the company’s highest innovations, comparable to the iPhone’s touch interface. “I think we’ll look back and it will be one of these air pockets that happened to get you on a different technology curve,” he told the WSJ.

Cuban uses AI’s utility beyond business, telling CNBC it is a tool to help review his children’s homework assignments. Starting his day between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., Cook combines AI tools with traditional productivity methods, reviewing overnight sales reports alongside his AI-summarized emails.

While Cook and Gates naturally discuss their companies’ proprietary tools, the market offers numerous alternatives for email management and meeting documentation, making similar efficiency gains accessible across organizations.
Still, their experiences suggest that AI adoption for routine tasks can create time savings when used correctly.
The trend suggests AI’s role in business is evolving from experimental tech to essential productivity tools, with leaders actively integrating the solutions into their daily routines.

20241120,AAPL,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Tech giant Apple has made a $100 million investment proposal to Indonesia to build a plant to manufacture accessories and components, the industry ministry said on Wednesday.
The proposal comes after Indonesia banned sales of Apple's iPhone 16 over the firm's failure to meet local rules on components. Indonesia requires certain smartphones sold domestically to comprise at least 40% locally-made parts.
The trade ministry will meet on Thursday to discuss Apple's proposed West Java plant, its spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arif said in a statement.
""By holding a meeting on Thursday, this means that the industry minister welcomes Apple's investment commitment,"" he said.
Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia, but has since 2018 set up application developer academies with a combined cost of 1.6 trillion rupiah ($99 million).
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.
Indonesia has also banned sales of smartphones made by Alphabet's for a similar reason.

20241120,AAPL,"By Jody Godoy
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Apple asked a federal judge on Wednesday to dismiss the U.S. Department of Justice's case accusing the iPhone maker of unlawfully dominating the smartphone market, in the latest Big Tech antitrust showdown.
U.S. District Judge Julien Neals in Newark, New Jersey, heard arguments from lawyers for Apple who said the government's case should be dismissed on multiple grounds and asked the judge to limit the discovery process. Discovery refers to the exchange of information among parties in a case.
""The government has failed to plausibly allege that Apple has monopoly power,"" said Apple lawyer Devora Allon.
Prosecutors are expected to say the company locks users in and keeps competition out by limiting interoperability between the iPhone and third-party apps and devices.
Apple has moved to dismiss the case, saying its limitations on developers' access to its technology were reasonable, and that forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation.
Antitrust cases against Big Tech firms are a bipartisan trend. The case against Apple began during the first presidential term of Donald Trump and was filed during the administration of President Joe Biden.
In other cases, Alphabet's Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in online search, Meta Platforms faces trial on claims that it squelched competition by acquiring upstart rivals, and Amazon.com is fighting a case over its policies toward sellers and suppliers.
But some claims like the ones at the heart of the Apple case have ultimately failed.
A judge dismissed the Federal Trade Commission's claim against Meta over the social-media platform's restrictions on third-party app developers.
In the Google search case, the judge rejected a claim that Google should have done more to accommodate advertisers on Microsoft's search engine Bing.
Apple cited the ruling in its own case, saying it shows that withholding access to technology should not be considered anticompetitive.
The Apple lawsuit filed in March by the DOJ and a coalition of states takes aim at restrictions and fees on app developers, and technical roadblocks to third-party devices and services - such as smart watches, digital wallets and messaging services - that would compete with its own.
If the judge finds the claims plausible, the case will be allowed to move forward.

20241120,AAPL,"Apple has made a rare disclosure of the revenue generated from its App Store in China, as the US tech giant grapples with a controversy surrounding the so-called Apple Tax - commission fees that the company charges developers for using its app store and in-app payment system.
Apple China on Monday published an article on its official website that cited a report by a Shanghai University of Finance and Economics researcher, saying that the local App Store paid over 95 per cent of the 3.76 trillion yuan (US$519 billion) in revenue it generated last year to Chinese developers and various companies.
""We're proud that the investments we make in the App Store have helped it become a powerful growth engine for local businesses of all sizes,"" Apple chief executive Tim Cook wrote on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo. He said that the company is committed to the success of entrepreneurs across China.

It is unclear whether the study was sponsored by Apple. The company and the report's author Ju Heng did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

Apple is under pressure to appease app developers in China, as local rival Huawei Technologies is aggressively pushing its iOS and Android alternative, HarmonyOS. In the first quarter, HarmonyOS overtook Apple's iOS to become the second-biggest mobile operating system in mainland China, according to Counterpoint Research.
While strong iPhone 16 sales have lifted Apple back to second place in China's smartphone market in the third quarter, the company has yet to announce when it will bring its new in-app artificial intelligence function, Apple Intelligence, to users on the mainland, to the dismay of some local users.
Apple's app-store business model has come under increasing scrutiny around the world, with European regulators reportedly considering a fine on the company for restricting app developers from pointing users to payment options outside the US company's ecosystem.
In May, Apple won a landmark court case in Shanghai, filed by a local consumer who claimed that the company was abusing its market dominance by charging unfairly high commission fees.

However, Apple is still locked in a dispute with Chinese social media and video gaming giant Tencent Holdings. Players of WeChat mini games are currently able to top up credits using third-party payment services, allowing Tencent to circumvent Apple's typical 30 per cent commission cut. The US company has been asking Tencent to fix the loophole.
Tencent was negotiating with Apple regarding the sharing of revenue generated by WeChat mini games, the Chinese company's chief strategy officer James Mitchell said in an earnings call in August.
The report cited by Apple on Monday said that most Chinese developers do not have to pay App Store commissions. For those who do, half were paying a discounted rate of 15 per cent last year, according to the study.

20241120,AAPL,"The Justice Department apparently wants Google's empire to be broken up, but it has to convince a judge that should happen first.
The process starts Wednesday when US prosecutors are expected to submit a document in federal court outlining specific remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly.
The DOJ is expected to ask Google's parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) to sell off its Chrome browser, according to a report in Bloomberg. The Wall Street Journal reported that divestments could include the Android mobile operating system if Google doesn't meet certain conditions.
Prosecutors may also call for new data licensing requirements or an end to agreements that secure Google's search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.
DOJ outlined a framework of options last month, but the filing Wednesday is expected to be a lot more specific about what it wants to happen.

It will then be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ’s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen next in a separate ""remedies"" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.
A DOJ breakup request would be the latest of many aggressive signals sent to the tech world during a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.
The administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.
""The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,"" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Yahoo Finance in an email.
""The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.""
It is not yet known whether a new Trump administration would let all of those Big Tech antitrust cases continue.
Some legal experts don't expect the crackdown to let up. After all, it was Trump's DOJ that initiated the antitrust suit against Google after it concluded the company used illegal tactics to monopolize search.
But Trump in October also suggested that Google’s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.
""What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it’s more fair,"" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview.
Story Continues
He described Google’s search engine as ""rigged"" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.
The proposal to carve up Google would be the first step from the Justice Department to break apart a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).

That case resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.
A DOJ request to divest part of Google’s empire isn’t surprising, according to Vanderbilt Law School associate dean for research Rebecca Allensworth, because ""it makes sense to ask for more than you are going to get.""
But what she expects the judge to actually approve is data sharing as opposed to a spin-off of Chrome.
""We don’t know what the judge is going to impose yet,"" she told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.
Jean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine provider Brave, said a spin-off of Chrome is not likely to achieve the government's goals.
""My opinion is that if you have a browser — Safari, Firefox, Brave, whatever — and you send traffic to Google, then you should be compensated in a nondiscriminatory manner,"" Schmetz said.
""At the moment,"" Schmetz added, ""you only get money if you promise to Google that you're not going to compete against them.""

Judge Mehta has scheduled a remedies hearing to take place in April, and he has previously said he plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025.
Google has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.
The judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.
And even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.
What is not yet known is how Trump’s term, which starts Jan. 20, could alter how this case is resolved.
Google is ""going to appeal this case,"" former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist Neil Chilson told Yahoo Finance. ""We are probably pretty far from any total final resolution.""

20241120,AAPL,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple sold fewer smartphones during China's Singles' Day shopping festival this year as it faced pressure from an ""abnormally high"" number of rival handsets launched around the event, Counterpoint Research said on Wednesday.
The iPhone manufacturer saw its sales decline year-on-year by ""double digit percentages"" from Oct. 18 to Nov. 10, the research consultancy said. In comparison, its main rival in China, Huawei, recorded 7% sales growth, fueled by price cuts on its Pura 70 and Mate 60 models.
Xiaomi also saw sales decline, with volumes falling 6%.
""To capitalize on one of the biggest sales festivals of the year, major Chinese OEMs (manufacturers) except Huawei launched their latest flagships ahead of the festival,"" Counterpoint said, describing this as a key reason for Apple's decline. Only Xiaomi did so last year, it noted.
Huawei declined to comment. Apple and Xiaomi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Overall, smartphone sales in China during the event, the country's biggest online shopping festival, fell 9% year-on-year as a slowing economy weighed on consumer enthusiasm despite the promotions, Counterpoint said.
Apple's Singles' Day performance underscores the growing competition it faces in the world's largest smartphone market, especially from Huawei which has come back strongly in the premium segment.
The U.S. tech giant has since responded with multiple discount campaigns to boost sales. Apple's iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max were the festival's best selling models, Counterpoint said.
China's e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and JD.com did not release sales figures for the festival, having dropped the practice in 2022, but Alibaba said Apple and Xiaomi were among brands that surpassed 1 billion yuan in gross merchandising value.

20241120,AAPL,"Investing.com - President Capital Management downgraded Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock, citing mounting challenges, including regulatory risks, Apple’s shift to self-developed 4G/5G modem chips, a slowdown in its licensing (QTL) business, and weakness in the AI PC segment.
Apple’s move to in-house modem chips is poised to significantly erode Qualcomm’s profits in the coming years, the note said. With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) historically representing a substantial share of Qualcomm’s revenue, the impact is expected to grow as the tech giant further reduces its reliance on third-party suppliers.
Though Qualcomm is working to diversify its revenue streams as it prepares for the end of its lucrative partnership with Apple.
The company’s QTL licensing business, however, is also showing signs of slowing. While the high-end smartphone market remains robust, future licensing gains are increasingly dependent on growth in the automotive and IoT sectors.
Despite these challenges, Qualcomm’s stock has risen about 14% this year. It was trading at $165 on Tuesday trading. The San Diego-based company remains the largest supplier of smartphone chips, benefiting from a recovery in the smartphone market as consumers upgrade devices for artificial intelligence applications like chatbots and image generators.
Earlier this month, Qualcomm set its fiscal first-quarter revenue target at $10.9 billion, with projected earnings per share of $2.95. The period includes the holiday shopping season in key markets such as the U.S. and Europe, signaling optimism about near-term demand despite looming headwinds.

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's ""easy"" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some ""serious gains.""
""I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It’s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don’t count. But that, people, is nonsense.""
Cramer said banks do not ""care"" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.
""I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I’m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.""

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) threw it out of the park with its latest quarterly results amid strong Cloud growth. Amazon Web Services has generated $27.5 billion in revenue, marking a 19% year-over-year increase. The segment’s operating income is expanding at nearly 2.5 times the rate of its revenue growth, boosting Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s overall operating income. At this pace, AWS is on track to deliver $110 billion in annualized revenue. If it maintains its ~20% growth rate, AWS could reach $125-130 billion in revenue in FY 2025.
For the ongoing quarter, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) expects revenue between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, implying growth of up to 11%. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 32.9, higher than the big tech average of 25.5. If Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) grows its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 25% annually over the next three years, it could achieve an EPS of around $9.25 by FY 2027 (up from an estimated $4.74 in FY 2024). Applying a 35x P/E ratio in line with Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) historical average suggests a fair stock value of over $300. The primary catalyst for this target would be AWS’s robust operating income growth.

“The largest absolute detractors were Alphabet, Airbnb, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon’s position as a notable detractor speaks more to the size of the position than the magnitude of the underperformance, as the company delivered a solid set of results during the quarter.

20241120,AMZN,"We came across a bullish thesis on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) on wallstreetbets Subreddit Page by FerociousTiger1433. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on BABA. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA)'s share was trading at $88.59 as of Nov 15th. BABA’s trailing and forward P/E were 22.94 and 10.27 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
Informatica (NYSE:INFA) Enhances Enterprise AI with GenAI Blueprints, Supporting Seamless Integration Across Leading Cloud Platforms
A computer engineer seated in front of several connected consoles, illustrating the depth of cloud services offered by the company.
Alibaba (BABA) is not just a leading e-commerce player; its cloud division, Alibaba Cloud, is becoming a dominant force in the rapidly expanding cloud market in Asia. As the number one cloud provider in the Asia-Pacific region, with nearly 40% market share, Alibaba Cloud is uniquely positioned to capture the region's massive growth, which is expected to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4% by 2028. While its Western counterparts, Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure, are major players globally, Alibaba’s stronghold in Asia and its tailored approach to local markets set it apart. Countries like China, Indonesia, and Malaysia rely heavily on Alibaba Cloud for their digital transformation, with the company continuing to innovate through proprietary AI solutions like QWEN, which rivals OpenAI's GPT in several areas.
The cloud market in Asia is still in the early stages of penetration, offering Alibaba a long runway for growth. The region’s cloud market, which was worth $120 billion in 2023, is expected to more than double by 2028, far outpacing the U.S. market. Alibaba’s infrastructure, covering 28 global regions and over 90 availability zones, gives it an edge in this fast-growing sector, especially as increasing internet adoption, the rollout of 5G, and government incentives drive cloud demand. Alibaba Cloud’s growth is increasingly becoming a major profit engine for the company, much like Amazon’s AWS. While Alibaba’s cloud division is not yet as profitable as AWS, its margins are improving, and the rise in AI-driven demand for compute resources positions it to capture a significant share of this opportunity.
Despite facing regulatory challenges in China, Alibaba Cloud benefits from a favorable environment. The Chinese government promotes Alibaba Cloud’s adoption as part of its national digital strategy, further solidifying its position in the market. Moreover, Alibaba Cloud is expanding internationally, with new data centers being developed in Mexico, expanding its reach beyond Asia.
Valuation-wise, Alibaba is significantly undervalued compared to its Western counterparts. With a price-to-earnings ratio of just 10x, compared to 34x for Microsoft and 62x for Amazon, Alibaba presents an attractive investment opportunity, especially given its cloud revenue growth rate of 30% in Asia. This discount is largely attributed to ongoing concerns over China’s regulatory environment, but for investors who believe in the long-term growth of cloud computing in Asia, this presents a rare value opportunity.
Story Continues
In addition to the cloud division’s growth prospects, Alibaba’s stock is buoyed by a $25 billion buyback program, signaling the company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders. There is also speculation that Alibaba Cloud could eventually be spun off, potentially unlocking massive value for investors, much like AWS did for Amazon. With an upside potential of 30% in the base case and 70% in the bull case, Alibaba presents an exceptional risk/reward opportunity. However, risks remain, particularly from regulatory pressures in China. Nonetheless, as the company continues to leverage its strong position in Asia’s booming cloud market, Alibaba’s stock is poised for significant upside in the coming years.
Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 91 hedge fund portfolios held BABA at the end of the second quarter which was 103 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Artificial intelligence has been making headlines even at political summits. For example, news agency Xinhua recently reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro recently, warning that artificial intelligence should not be a game of rich countries and the wealthy. The Chinese president also called for more international governance and cooperation on AI. During another appearance, Xi also referred to increasing tariffs on Chinese goods, terming it protectionism in the name of green and low-carbon development. Xi said the world economy should be characterized by openness.

Chicago, IL – November 20, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are Amazon.com AMZN, Maplebear Inc. CART, Exelixis EXEL and Doximity DOCS.
Hunting for Earnings Beats? Try These 4 Top-Ranked Stocks
It is not surprising that before any earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality.
In this regard, we ran a screener that yielded stocks Amazon.com, Maplebear Inc., Exelixis and Doximity as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential.
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?
Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.
Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.
On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.
Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?
Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.
Here are four out of 20 stocks:
Amazon.com:The Zacks Rank #1 company is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

20241120,AMZN,"The Justice Department apparently wants Google's empire to be broken up, but it has to convince a judge that should happen first.
The process starts Wednesday when US prosecutors are expected to submit a document in federal court outlining specific remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly.
The DOJ is expected to ask Google's parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) to sell off its Chrome browser, according to a report in Bloomberg. The Wall Street Journal reported that divestments could include the Android mobile operating system if Google doesn't meet certain conditions.
Prosecutors may also call for new data licensing requirements or an end to agreements that secure Google's search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.
DOJ outlined a framework of options last month, but the filing Wednesday is expected to be a lot more specific about what it wants to happen.

It will then be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ’s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen next in a separate ""remedies"" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.
A DOJ breakup request would be the latest of many aggressive signals sent to the tech world during a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.
The administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.
""The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,"" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Yahoo Finance in an email.
""The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.""
It is not yet known whether a new Trump administration would let all of those Big Tech antitrust cases continue.
Some legal experts don't expect the crackdown to let up. After all, it was Trump's DOJ that initiated the antitrust suit against Google after it concluded the company used illegal tactics to monopolize search.
But Trump in October also suggested that Google’s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.
""What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it’s more fair,"" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview.
Story Continues
He described Google’s search engine as ""rigged"" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.
The proposal to carve up Google would be the first step from the Justice Department to break apart a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).

That case resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.
A DOJ request to divest part of Google’s empire isn’t surprising, according to Vanderbilt Law School associate dean for research Rebecca Allensworth, because ""it makes sense to ask for more than you are going to get.""
But what she expects the judge to actually approve is data sharing as opposed to a spin-off of Chrome.
""We don’t know what the judge is going to impose yet,"" she told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.
Jean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine provider Brave, said a spin-off of Chrome is not likely to achieve the government's goals.
""My opinion is that if you have a browser — Safari, Firefox, Brave, whatever — and you send traffic to Google, then you should be compensated in a nondiscriminatory manner,"" Schmetz said.
""At the moment,"" Schmetz added, ""you only get money if you promise to Google that you're not going to compete against them.""

Judge Mehta has scheduled a remedies hearing to take place in April, and he has previously said he plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025.
Google has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.
The judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.
And even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.
What is not yet known is how Trump’s term, which starts Jan. 20, could alter how this case is resolved.
Google is ""going to appeal this case,"" former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist Neil Chilson told Yahoo Finance. ""We are probably pretty far from any total final resolution.""

The advent of artificial intelligence has shaken up the Search business on the internet, a domain where Google has long reigned supreme. With AI models from startups like OpenAI, companies are offering natural language search capabilities to users that are cutting away Google's dominance in the Search market. Latest reports from news publication Bloomberg suggest that Google now faces added pressure with authorities in the US reportedly pushing the firm to spin off its Chrome browser business. The report further claims that authorities are also planning to recommend to a federal judge that Google face antitrust requirements related to AI and its Android mobile operating system.

The measures are a byproduct of a multilayer case that the Justice Department has built against Google. The government won the first round in the case earlier this year, which sought to prove that the tech giant has a web search monopoly in the US. In the ruling on this case, federal judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets. Per the Justice Department, the case against Chrome stems from the fact that the browser is a key access point through which many people use Google Search. Chrome controls about 61% of the browser market in the US, according to web traffic service StatCounter.

20241120,NFLX,"Investors with an interest in Broadcast Radio and Television stocks have likely encountered both Fox Corporation (FOX) and Netflix (NFLX). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Fox Corporation and Netflix are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FOX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.
FOX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.71, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 44.06. We also note that FOX has a PEG ratio of 1.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.68.
Another notable valuation metric for FOX is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 16.39.
Based on these metrics and many more, FOX holds a Value grade of A, while NFLX has a Value grade of D.
FOX sticks out from NFLX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FOX is the better option right now.

20241120,NFLX,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX).
Netflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.91, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.91 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.1% and 4.9% of all recommendations.
Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX

Check price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>

The ABR suggests buying Netflix, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Story Continues
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.
Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.
Is NFLX a Good Investment?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $19.78.
Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Netflix.

20241120,NFLX,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
See our latest analysis for Netflix
How Fast Is Netflix Growing?
If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, Netflix has grown EPS by 17% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Netflix is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 7.3 percentage points to 26%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.

Are Netflix Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?
Since Netflix has a market capitalisation of US$352b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$2.1b. We note that this amounts to 0.6% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Netflix but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.
Does Netflix Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?
As previously touched on, Netflix is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusive discounted cashflow valuation of Netflix. You might benefit from giving it a glance today.

20241120,NFLX,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:
“When it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.”
READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks
Cramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.
Another sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.
While some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.
Similarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they’re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.
As for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they’ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.

“We need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we’re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.”
Our Methodology
For this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)
Cramer likes Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) but mentioned the constant increase in stock price because of a stream of analyst price target increases.
“[The] second group that's getting maybe too much love: This market is nuts for subscription products. I like these stocks too… They all have huge recurring revenue streams and membership dues, and their stocks are huge winners. All these are benefiting from endless positive research calls, they just appear each morning as if by magic. Netflix has the most fanboys and analysts will come out and raise its price target based on the new ad model, which is going so well. Then the stock goes higher, and then another analyst will come out the next day and raise her price target for the same reason. It just won't stop, always on the same piece of information. That is not cricket.”
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a leading global provider of streaming entertainment, offering a vast array of movies, TV shows, and original content to millions of subscribers worldwide. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported a strong financial performance, with revenue growing by 15%, driven primarily by a 14% increase in its subscriber base. A key factor contributing to this growth is the rise in subscription prices, particularly in its core markets of the U.S. and Canada, where users are now paying an average of 5% more than the previous year.
As of September 30, the company's subscriber count reached an impressive 283 million, a number that continues to climb each quarter. Spencer Neumann, the company’s CFO, noted that there are still ""hundreds of millions of households that aren't members,"" suggesting significant potential for further growth. Looking ahead, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is projecting between $6 billion and $6.5 billion in free cash flow for fiscal year 2024.
Overall NFLX ranks 4th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241120,NFLX,"Investing.com -- Netflix closed higher Monday as the streaming giant hailed the live streaming boxing match between YouTube star Jake Paul and former heavyweight world champion Mike Tyson a ""huge success"" despite technical issues.,
The fight hit a peak of 65 million viewers, according to Netflix, but the sheer number of users caused challenges for the streaming giant, with users complaining about stream quality, resulting in buffering, frozen screens, and connection issues.
The technical issues were acknowledged by Netflix CTO Elizabeth Stone in a memo to employees, Bloomberg reported.
“This unprecedented scale created many technical challenges, which the launch team tackled brilliantly by prioritizing stability of the stream for the majority of viewers,” Stone said in the memo seen by Bloomberg.
While the fight didn't quite live up to expectations as Paul, 31, claimed a victory against Tyson, 58, via unanimous decision, the event on Friday was hailed a success by Stone despite the streaming issues.
""We don’t want to dismiss the poor experience of some members, and know we have room for improvement, but still consider this event a huge success,"" Stone said in the memo.
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) closed more than 2% higher on Monday.

20241120,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX) shares recovered from earlier losses on Monday after the streaming giant's highly anticipated boxing event between heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and YouTube personality Jake Paul experienced technical glitches throughout the live broadcast.
The issues have sparked concerns about the company's ability to deliver other types of live programs, especially with the upcoming NFL Christmas Day games in just over a month.
Customers complained about buffering disruptions and streaming issues while watching the event Friday night. Downdetector, which tracks internet outages, received thousands of outage reports throughout the evening.
Netflix declined to directly comment on the glitches when asked by Yahoo Finance.
Since the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged over 70%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Shares climbed more than 2% in afternoon trade on Monday.

Bandwidth issues were likely at fault: The company revealed 60 million households around the world tuned in to watch. It alluded to the technical problems in an Instagram post, saying the event ""even had our buffering systems on the ropes.""
But it's not the first time Netflix has faced technical glitches from its various live events, which have included comedy specials and reunion tapings. That's led to investor concerns the company won't be able to get things right in time for its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans.
Multiple users on social media platforms vented their frustrations, explicitly calling out the streaming issues and disruptions throughout the night.
Still, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein shrugged off the customer complaints, writing in a note to clients on Sunday that viewing was likely twice as large as the company's internal expectations, ""a high quality problem than can be easily fixed by Christmas Day.""
Netflix inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Late Sunday, the company announced Beyoncé as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show. It will be the first time the artist will perform her Grammy-nominated album ""Cowboy Cater"" live.

Assuming 2.5 viewers per household, Helfstein estimated about 150 million global viewers tuned in to watch the Tyson-Paul event. That's greater than the 124 million US viewers who watched the 2024 Super Bowl, the highest viewership for any US broadcast.
The analyst, who has an Outperform rating on shares, called out Netflix's ability to generate massive viewership, ""suggesting the company will be successful with advertising around live events.""
Last week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.
Of note: Monthly active users, otherwise known as MAUs, are not the same as paying subscribers. The company has yet to reveal actual subscriber figures for the ad tier or how much revenue it's generated so far. MAUs can include multiple people using the same account.
Netflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.
Still, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to the company's ability to raise prices and boost growth.
""With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.
Valuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock ""is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025."" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 19, Stifel raised the price target on the stock to $180 from $165 and kept a Buy rating on the shares ahead of the company reporting its fiscal Q3 results. Supply chain data points, as well as discussions with industry participants, remain skewed positively and the advisory expects another beat/raise scenario, Stifel tells investors. While expectations are elevated and this scenario appears to be widely anticipated given that consensus estimates for FY26 and FY27 have moved roughly 4% higher over the past two weeks, the advisory’s checks suggest that a Blackwell driven inflection to the upside is more likely an April quarter event than January and believes that a diverse set of data points support the positive revisions.

20241120,NVDA,"(Bloomberg) -- US stocks stumbled as investors braced for Nvidia Corp. earnings and weighed the latest Ukraine-Russia tensions. The dollar rose.

The S&P 500 fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq 100 slid 0.9%, paring an earlier loss of more than 1% following Ukraine’s missile strikes on Russia. Investors are awaiting Nvidia Corp.’s quarterly results after the market closes to gauge if the stock can continue its remarkable run. Shares of the world’s most valuable company erased much of an earlier 2.9% loss.
Trading in options signals the results will be the most important catalyst left this year — more than the Federal Reserve’s December meeting, according to Barclays Plc strategists.
Treasuries fell across the curve after an auction of 20-year bonds received a lukewarm reception, adding to the cautious tone on Wall Street.
“The health of the market being driven by results of individual companies in itself points to a certain element of fragility,” said Subitha Subramaniam, chief economist at Sarasin & Partners. “Is it sufficient that they beat, is it sufficient that they beat by a big margin? We are hanging on every statement of the CEO.”
Bloomberg’s gauge of the dollar advanced 0.4%, rebounding from a three-day drop. US Treasuries struggled to erase losses while Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, advanced for the second day, jumping as much as 15%.
Shares of Target Corp. fell after the retailer trimmed its full-year outlook due to flat sales and an inventory buildup. Company executives said US consumers spent less on nonessential items such as clothes and home products — a weaker third-quarter picture than the one provided by Walmart Inc. on Tuesday.
Traders are also monitoring Donald Trump’s administration picks, especially his selection for the Treasury secretary role. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and Apollo Global Management’s Marc Rowan are in contention, according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, Trump tapped Cantor Fitzgerald LP Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department, a key role to facilitate his tariff and trade policies.
“As I look at the Treasury secretary race, I want to see exactly who is in that role because the tax policies, the debt limit all come back,” Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, told Bloomberg Television. “We need to see exactly how that person has a relationship with the Federal Reserve, because monetary policy will quickly figure into all of this.”

Artificial intelligence businesses have taken Wall Street by storm in the past few months. One of the most notable success stories has been OpenAI, the AI startup that has become the most valuable private firm in the world with a valuation of over $157 billion. However, the company is facing multiple lawsuits regarding the use of data from news publications without attribution. After US-based The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune took the company to court, Indian news publication ANI has also alleged that the ChatGPT creator is using published content without permission to help train the AI chatbot to provide information to users.

Even as it faces these lawsuits, the company is blazing forward with plans to expand the use of the AI chatbot. Kevin Weil, the chief product officer of the company, recently announced on social media platform X that the firm is expanding the Advanced Voice Mode feature of ChatGPT to the web. This will let users talk to the AI chatbot right from their browser. However, the latest feature will only be available to Plus, Enterprise, Teams, or Edu subscribers, the paid members of ChatGPT. This feature is already available on the standalone applications of the product on popular mobile software platforms like Android and iOS.

20241120,NVDA,"Jensen Huang Says Building Nvidia Was A 'Million Times Harder' Than He Expected
Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) became the world’s most valuable company earlier this year on the back of surging demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang founded the multi-billion dollar chip company more than 30 years ago and recently talked about what it would take to pit expectations against reality and do it all over again.
Starting a successful company is “insanely hard,” Huang said last year on an episode of the tech podcast, “Acquired.”

This rooftop wind turbine is taking on a market projected to reach over $900 billion by 2032 — With already over 40,000 users signing up to purchase, here's a chance to be an early investor today!
This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before it closes TONIGHT.
“And when I see these amazing companies getting built, I have nothing but admiration and respect because I just know it’s insanely hard,” he added. “You could do all of the right things and still fail.”
Building Nvidia was “a million times harder” than Huang expected it to be. Knowing what he knows now about launching a business, he’s not so sure if he would do it all again. For those who want to try, he offered an interesting piece of advice: Underestimate the challenge.
In order to be a successful entrepreneur, you have to “trick your brain” into thinking a particular challenge is not as difficult as it really is.
“You have to get yourself to believe that it’s not that hard because it’s way harder than you think,” Huang said.
If you can maintain a “How hard can it be?” mindset, he suggested that you will wield an entrepreneurial superpower that can get you through tough times.
“If I go taking all of my knowledge now, and I go back, and I said I’m going to endure that whole journey again, I think it’s too much,” he said.
Huang attributed much of Nvidia’s success to the people around him, who never gave up. He named several team members who have been at the company since the very beginning.
He said that if you surround yourself with people who share the same mindset, you can get through the tough times. However, you still have to trick yourself every day into thinking it’s not as hard as it really is.
“I’m surrounded by these people that never one time gave up and they never one time gave up on me. That’s the entire ball of wax,” the Nvidia founder and CEO said.

As NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market—and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO).
What To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry.
Broadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers—critical components for Nvidia’s AI-focused operations.

This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.
A strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.
Historically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia’s during major market reactions. Nvidia’s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.
How To Buy AVGO Stock
By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.
Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.
If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

20241120,NVDA,"(Bloomberg) -- With Nvidia Corp. due to report an unusually complex quarter as the world’s most valuable company, traders are preparing for a potentially mammoth stock swing.

The options-implied move for Nvidia shares the day after earnings is about 8% in either direction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would equate to close to a $300 billion swing in market value — bigger than all but 25 companies in the S&P 500 Index. And according to strategists at Bank of America, the report carries more risk for the benchmark than the next Federal Reserve meeting or inflation data.
As the poster child of the artificial intelligence trade, Nvidia’s stock has rallied nearly 200% so far in 2024 and its reports have been the biggest event on the earnings calendar for more than a year. The shares fell 1.9% on Wednesday ahead of the chipmaker’s fiscal third quarter earnings, due after markets close, and there’s more uncertainty than normal about how the results and guidance will play out.
That’s because there are varying views on Wall Street about what to expect from the company’s newest product line, Blackwell. Nvidia has said that the new chips will contribute several billion dollars in revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, while Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang described demand for the chips as “insane.” But production delays have made modeling supply — a notoriously difficult task — even harder.
“There’s a big unknown around Blackwell capacity,” said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group. “The CEO has established a lot of credibility, but the bar is very high,” he said, adding that it will likely be challenging for Nvidia to give blowout guidance for next quarter.
The questions around Blackwell have led to a wide spread in analyst expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter that ends in January. Consensus is at $37.1 billion — with the gap between the highest and lowest projections at more than $7 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia typically provides revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter with its results.
Part of the reason for the gap in analyst forecasts is that some expect customers to delay purchases of Blackwell’s predecessor products, called Hopper, in anticipation of the newer chips.
Story Continues
That’s what Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore is anticipating and why he’s calling Wednesday’s results a “transitional” quarter. Nvidia is likely to give a conservative forecast that’s only slightly ahead of the average analyst estimate, which should satisfy most investors as long as everything points to a very strong full-year Blackwell ramp, Moore wrote.
Jim Worden, chief investment officer of Wealth Consulting Group, is also less concerned about the timing of Blackwell, with all signs pointing to strong demand.
“I expect we’ll see a very good showing with Blackwell and how much it is shipping,” he said. “That trend should continue on into next year.”
The chipmaker’s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., all pledged in their most recent results to pump more into capital spending in the year ahead.
However, with a history of beating estimates in a big way, thanks to unbridled demand for its accelerator chips, Nvidia may need to do more than provide assurances that Blackwell’s ramp up remains strong. In the past five quarters, Nvidia sales have beaten consensus by an average of about $1.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
If Nvidia results fall short of that bar, it could spell trouble for the stock, which is trading close to a record high.
“The stock could be volatile, even on a really good report,” Worden said. The market may be expecting perfection, “and to the extent it isn’t perfect, the stock could pull back.”
Rick Bensignor, chief executive officer of Bensignor Investment Strategies and a former Morgan Stanley strategist, agrees.
“It can’t just beat the consensus, but also the whisper-type numbers that people are looking for,” he said. “If it disappoints, we can easily see it come off 10% or so.”
For the broader market, the implications of Nvidia’s results might not have been fully priced in, said Charlie McElligott, Nomura’s cross asset strategist at Nomura. Option straddles on the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF are only implying a 1.7% move for Thursday. “That maybe ‘feels’ light,” McElligott wrote.

20241120,MSFT,"Microsoft 'One Of The Most Compelling Investment Opportunities,' Says Goldman Sachs
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a top pick for Goldman Sachs, which sees significant upside in the company's stock.
In a client note released Wednesday, equity analyst Kash Rangan described Microsoft as ""one of the most compelling investment opportunities"" in the tech space, citing its robust position across the cloud stack and growing momentum in artificial intelligence (AI).
The investment bank maintained its Buy rating on the stock, setting a 12-month price target of $500. This projection suggests a 20% upside from Microsoft’s current price levels, driven by anticipated growth across its cloud and AI offerings.

Microsoft Positioned For Long-Term Secular Trends
Rangan emphasized Microsoft’s dominant presence across the entire cloud stack, from applications to infrastructure.
“With a strong presence across all layers of the cloud stack, Microsoft is well-positioned, in our view, to capitalize on a number of long-term secular trends, such as Gen-AI, public cloud consumption, SaaS adoption, and digital transformation,” Rangan stated.
He highlighted these trends could drive sustainable growth, supported by Microsoft's ability to integrate its services seamlessly across its ecosystem.
Microsoft already built a competitive edge in the generative AI market through its Azure cloud platform.
According to Rangan, AI workloads are growing more complex, with 93% of use cases relying on three or more model providers. Microsoft's efforts to mitigate these challenges, including the development of custom chips and advanced hardware, position it as a leader in the AI infrastructure space.
Trending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before it closes TONIGHT.
Azure Innovations and Adoption Drive Growth
Goldman Sachs sees Azure's custom silicon as a game changer in tackling the increasing demand for AI processing power. ""Azure's custom chips extend GPU architecture and alleviate capacity constraints,"" Rangan stated.
Story Continues
Key innovations such as Azure Cobalt — delivering a 50% improvement in price performance — and Azure Boost DPU — cutting server power usage by threefold while quadrupling performance — offer a strong value proposition.
Azure AI services are also gaining traction, with offerings like the AI Foundry (currently in preview), AI Agent Service (coming soon), and Copilot Studio (already used by over 100,000 organizations).
Usage of Azure OpenAI Services has doubled in just six months, which, according to Rangan, demonstrates customers' growing ability to deploy real-world AI applications.
Stock Struggles While Azure Deceleration
Despite Microsoft's strong innovation pipeline, its stock has underperformed the Nasdaq by eight percentage points since reporting fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results. Slowing Azure growth has weighed on investor sentiment.
Yet, Rangan expects Azure's reacceleration in fiscal third-quarter 2025 to serve as the next major catalyst for the stock rebound.
Microsoft's commercial Office offerings also provide a significant growth lever. The analyst indicated that the platform boasts over 400 million commercial users, representing less than 50% of the global knowledge workforce, suggesting further expansion potential.
Expansive TAM and Secular Tailwinds
According to the investment bank, Microsoft stands out due to its expansive total addressable market (TAM) and the company's ability to capitalize on secular tailwinds like cloud adoption and digital transformation.
“While MSFT competes with a number of best-of-breed and platform providers across various layers of the tech stack, we believe the company's breadth of offerings and large installed base position the company to expand its share of wallet within customers' IT budgets,” Rangan wrote.

Users can try Teradata AI Unlimited on the Microsoft Fabric Workload Hub, using analytic functions without impacting their existing Teradata systems.

The integration supports open data formats in OneLake and open table architectures, ensuring better compatibility with other tools.
TDC Shares Underperform Industry & Sector
TDC shares have declined 32.2% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology Sector’s growth of 26.3% and the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry’s rise of 13.6%.

The decline in share price can be attributed to its slower revenue growth, coupled with stiff competition from Oracle ORCL and Snowflake SNOW, who are aggressively expanding their cloud and data analytics offerings.

Teradata has struggled to fully capitalize on the growing demand for cloud data analytics, which has affected its stock performance.

The company's shares have underperformed Oracle but beat Snowflake YTD. While ORCL shares have returned 79.2%, SNOW dropped 34.5%.
TDC’s Prospects Rides on Cloud and AI Solutions
Teradata provides a comprehensive analytical solution through its Teradata Vantage platform and VantageCloud with ClearScape Analytics. This integrated solution provides significant scale, speed and security across various environments, including on-premises, public/private clouds and hybrid setups.

TDC highlights promising growth prospects, particularly in its cloud segment. Public cloud’s annual recurring revenues at the third-quarter end surged by 26% year over year to $570 million, driven by robust demand for Teradata VantageCloud and ClearScape Analytics.

Teradata’s advancements in AI capabilities, particularly through enhancements to its ClearScape Analytics platform, have been well received and position the company as a key player in the AI space.

TDC’s integration with NVIDIA’s AI platform further strengthens its offering by providing high-performance, scalable AI capabilities, helping clients process and analyze large data sets more effectively.

These advancements are part of Teradata's broader strategy to position itself as a strategic AI partner for its customers, particularly as demand for AI-powered data analytics continues to grow.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year 2024 revenues is pegged at $1.75 billion, indicating a 4.41% decline on a year-over-year basis.

The agreement is a part of Microsoft's efforts to create an artificial intelligence model that has not yet been formally revealed, Bloomberg said.

20241120,MSFT,"The Justice Department apparently wants Google's empire to be broken up, but it has to convince a judge that should happen first.
The process starts Wednesday when US prosecutors are expected to submit a document in federal court outlining specific remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly.
The DOJ is expected to ask Google's parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) to sell off its Chrome browser, according to a report in Bloomberg. The Wall Street Journal reported that divestments could include the Android mobile operating system if Google doesn't meet certain conditions.
Prosecutors may also call for new data licensing requirements or an end to agreements that secure Google's search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.
DOJ outlined a framework of options last month, but the filing Wednesday is expected to be a lot more specific about what it wants to happen.
DOJ may ask for Google's empire to be broken up in a new document Wednesday. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) · NurPhoto via Getty Images
It will then be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ’s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen next in a separate ""remedies"" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.
A DOJ breakup request would be the latest of many aggressive signals sent to the tech world during a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.
The administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.
""The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,"" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Yahoo Finance in an email.
""The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.""
It is not yet known whether a new Trump administration would let all of those Big Tech antitrust cases continue.
Some legal experts don't expect the crackdown to let up. After all, it was Trump's DOJ that initiated the antitrust suit against Google after it concluded the company used illegal tactics to monopolize search.
But Trump in October also suggested that Google’s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.

That case resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.
A DOJ request to divest part of Google’s empire isn’t surprising, according to Vanderbilt Law School associate dean for research Rebecca Allensworth, because ""it makes sense to ask for more than you are going to get.""
But what she expects the judge to actually approve is data sharing as opposed to a spin-off of Chrome.
""We don’t know what the judge is going to impose yet,"" she told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.
Jean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine provider Brave, said a spin-off of Chrome is not likely to achieve the government's goals.
""My opinion is that if you have a browser — Safari, Firefox, Brave, whatever — and you send traffic to Google, then you should be compensated in a nondiscriminatory manner,"" Schmetz said.
""At the moment,"" Schmetz added, ""you only get money if you promise to Google that you're not going to compete against them.""

Judge Mehta has scheduled a remedies hearing to take place in April, and he has previously said he plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025.
Google has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.
The judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.
And even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.
What is not yet known is how Trump’s term, which starts Jan. 20, could alter how this case is resolved.
Google is ""going to appeal this case,"" former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist Neil Chilson told Yahoo Finance. ""We are probably pretty far from any total final resolution.""

With Donald Trump having won the elections, it seems Elon Musk is going to be a powerful force in the administration.  After all, X CEO has played an outsized role in his comeback, contributing millions to his campaign, serving as policy advisor, and even using his social media platform as a Make America Great Again (MAGA) advocacy platform.
Now that his efforts have come to fruition Max Tegmark, a leading scientist, who has previously worked with the world’s richest person says Musk’s influence could lead to tougher safety standards for artificial intelligence, as reported by The Guardian.

Tegmark says Musk’s backing of a failed AI bill demonstrated that Musk is still worried about the repercussions of uncontrolled AI development. The SB 1047 bill in California required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them.
Having frequently warned that such an unrestrained development can be catastrophic for humanity, Musk was one of the 30,000 others who had signed a letter calling for a pause on the development of advanced AI technology last year.
According to Tegmark, Musk could convince Trump to introduce standards that prevent the growth of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a term used for AI systems that match or surpass human levels of intelligence.
“I do think that if Elon manages to get Trump’s ear on AI issues we’re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI. He might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.”
Before Trump won the elections, Musk had predicted the development of artificial intelligence that would be smarter than the smartest human being by next year or by 2026.
""If you define AGI (artificial general intelligence) as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably next year, within two years”.

20241120,CRWD,"CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity leader, with a growth strategy centered on becoming the one-stop solution for all enterprise cybersecurity needs through platform expansion. Fundamentally, the company has a high-quality and stable earnings profile, driven by its strong recurring revenue base from the continued adoption of new product modules. At CrowdStrike's FY24 Investor Day, management announced its goal of reaching $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, which is supported by a strong free cash flow margin. However, this goal was affected by the global outage on July 19, which was due to the company releasing a flawed sensor configuration update for its Falcon platform, resulting in around 8.5 million Windows devices crashing. This caused significant reputational damage to the cybersecurity leader, as the outage led to grounded flights, canceled medical procedures and widespread disruption. Following this incident, the stock took a sharp dive, dropping from $345 to $264 on July 22, as investors reacted to the news.

CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
CRWD Data by GuruFocus
The repercussions from the July 19 outage was revealed when the company reported its Q2 FY25 earnings. Despite the outage, the company managed to outperform wall-street analysts' revenue and earnings expectations, leading to a 3% stock price increase following the earnings release. However, with its Q2 FY25 earnings results, management released its lowered top-line and bottom-line guidance for the upcoming quarters. Despite this lowered guidance, the stock largely rebounded, and is now in line with the S&P 500's YTD returns. My long-term investment perspective for CrowdStrike lies on one key trend in cybersecurity: the growing demand from enterprise customers to consolidate multiple-vendor solutions onto a single platform to cut costs. Consequently, the recent macroeconomic pressures have forced enterprise customers to focus on efficiency and find ways to do more with less. Thus, this key trend remains strong and I believe CrowdStrike is well-positioned to benefit, as it provides one of the top platforms in the market at significant cost-savings.
The Falcon Platform: One-Stop Shop
CrowdStrike is basically known as an endpoint protection company in the cybersecurity market, but I don't think this fully captures the scope of services that the company currently offers. In reality, it operates as a one-stop platform for enterprise cybersecurity solutions, which was a key point highlighted during its Q2 FY25 earnings presentation. While there are many competitors in the industry, no other competitor is able to offer the scope of services that CrowdStrike does. Thus, as mentioned previously, I believe that CrowdStrike is positioned well to benefit in a time where enterprises are increasingly looking to consolidate its cybersecurity infrastructure. As a result, CrowdStrike's platform is able to serve as a consolidated solution, which is difficult to compete with in the current cybersecurity landscape.

CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
[CrowdStrike IR]
George Kurtz (CEO of CrowdStrike) pointed out that enterprise customers are focused on efficiency and reducing complexity, noting that Customers don't want to go backwards and have a patchwork of products. They are still focused on the consolidation piece and they're looking at us as one of the key consolidators in the market"". What was actually meant by this statement is evident in the fact that about 65% of the company's customers use five or more modules, 45% use six or more and 30% use seven or modules. Furthermore, among larger customers that spend over $100,000 annually on CrowdStrike's services, nearly half use eight or more modules. This highlights the depth of the consolidation in CrowdStrike's cybersecurity customer portfolio, making it significantly challenging to compete with.
Further, I found a research piece from Gartner that noted that 75% of enterprise customers are actively looking to decrease the number of cybersecurity vendors that they work with, further supporting the industry trend of vendor consolidation. Thus, the primary goal for enterprise customers is to increase integration and lower vendor management costs, and this shift will likely result in a handful of dominant players emerging in the market. Given CrowdStrike's early focus on consolidation through its Falcon platform, it is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
Post-Outage Recovery
Post the outage on July 19, CrowdStrike experienced some disruption in its sales pipeline with a few deals placed on hold, and to be finalized in subsequent quarters. Consequently, management clarified to investors that the larger part of those delayed deals would still stay in the pipeline. That said, investors should be prepared to hear that some of the new customers are going to be more cautious than usual, since the company has lost some trust within the marketplace as a result of the outage. During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, CFO Burt Podbere noted the following: ""We expect to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, with additional scrutiny requiring higher levels of approval at the CEO and, in some cases, Board of Directors level."" The meaning behind this is simple: the longer the list of approvals, the more protracted the sales cycle will be, especially in large corporations. Although the CFO didn't mention the exact delay periods, I expect bigger deals to take close to six months to finalize.
To address the situation, it appears that CrowdStrike has introduced customer commitment packages, wherein the company gives a discount and other incentives to their customers in return for signing longer-term contracts. This may, however, affect the company's revenues for the next few quarters, but it's important to note that CrowdStrike still managed to win several eight and nine-figure deals despite the outage. For example, within cloud security, CrowdStrike secured an eight-figure deal with a major enterprise software firm, which opted to standardize on Falcon Cloud Security across its entire business, replacing another next-gen cloud security vendor. Similarly, a nine-figure cloud security deal saw a large enterprise adopt Falcon Cloud Security across a million hosts, replacing other cloud security products.
In the Security information and event management (SIEM) market, CrowdStrike continues to outperform legacy SIEM providers. Two major deals stand out: an eight-figure deal with an existing customer, which replaced two legacy SIEMs with CrowdStrike's LogScale, resulting in over 60% cost savings, and a seven-figure deal with a leading generative AI company, which standardized on LogScale after a year of use, improving search speed, response times, and total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to their previous legacy SIEM solution.
Expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)
CrowdStrike's growth story is further supported by the expanding TAM. In 2024, the TAM for cybersecurity is expected to be around $100 billion, but this figure is projected to grow to $225 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8%. Even if CrowdStrike only manages to grow in line with the market, the company has a long runway for growth. Given its platformization strategy, I believe CrowdStrike is positioned to outpace market growth and capture significant market share.
Strong Results Despite Challenges
CrowdStrike's Q2 FY25 results, in my view, basically showcase the company's resilience and strength, even in the face of significant adversity (with the recent outage and macro pressures). The company reported revenue of $964 million (up 31.7% YoY), overperforming wall-street guidance by $5.5 million. With 94% of its revenue coming from subscriptions, the growth in this segment is a key indicator of CrowdStrike's performance. Subscription revenue grew 33% YoY, while ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) was up 32%, reaching $3.9 billion. This included $218 million in net new ARR, an 11% increase YoY, in line with the company's guidance.

[CrowdStrike IR]
CrowdStrike also reported record non-GAAP operating income of $227 million, representing a 46% YoY increase, signaling excellent operational efficiency. Notably, non-GAAP operating income is growing faster than revenue, demonstrating the company's operating leverage, a key strength in the tech sector, where many companies prioritize growth over profitability.
Robust Cash Flow Generation
Free cash flows increased by 44% YoY to $272 million in Q2 FY25, with a 28% free cash flow margin, highlighting the company's ability to fund its own growth. The company achieved what it calls the ""rule of 60"" during the quarter. This means that the sum of its YoY revenue growth rate (approximately 32%) and its free cash flow margin (28%) equals 60. The term is derived from the ""rule of 40,"" a concept introduced by Brad Feld, who describes it as the idea that a company's growth rate combined with its profitability should total at least 40%. For example, a 20% growth rate should correspond with a 20% profit margin, while a 50% growth rate could be paired with a 10% loss. Exceeding this benchmark is rare, which is why investors tend to value CrowdStrike more highly compared to other growth stocks.
Lowered Management Guidance
Although the company reported great Q2 FY25 results despite the outage, the repercussions of the outage is largely reflected in CrowdStrike's full-year guidance. Management lowered its initial revenue guidance for FY25 by 1.5%, now expecting revenue to be between $3.896 billion and $3.989 billion, down from the original forecast of $3.924 billion to $3.989 billion. Non-GAAP operating income guidance was also reduced by 11.23%, with the new midpoint at $788.5 million, down from $888.3 million. While Q3 FY25 is expected to show continued revenue growth of 34.2%, non-GAAP operating income growth is forecasted to slow to 8.3%, reflecting the near-term impact of the outage on profitability.
Capacity For Continued Investments
I have already mentioned Crowdstrike's ability to drive impressive revenue growth and operational efficiency. But, in addition to this, the reason that I'm bullish on the company is mainly due to the fact that CrowdStrike's fundamental strengths are also backed by its commitment to reinvest back into the core business. Looking at the closest rival to CrowdStrike (Palo Alto Networks), CrowdStrike's Capex to CFO ratio is relatively higher. Although Palo Alto Networks has larger R&D capex spending in absolute terms, if CRWD sustains its impressive CFO growth, it will likely close the gap with PANW soon. CrowdStrike's top-line and CFO is growing much faster compared to rivals.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
CRWD Data by GuruFocus
Strong Balance Sheet
CrowdStrike also maintains a solid balance sheet. As of Q2 FY25, the company held $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents against $743.2 million in long-term debt, giving it a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of 0.28. Furthermore, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.75 suggests that CrowdStrike can comfortably manage its debt using operating profits. Furthermore, while some competitors and investors overhyped the potential for CrowdStrike to lose business, the company's operating leverage remains on track. With its continued focus on platform consolidation, I expect CrowdStrike to maintain its leadership position and recover from the recent setbacks caused by the outage.
Valuation Thoughts
From a valuation standpoint, I am quite optimistic about CrowdStrike's potential. I believe CrowdStrike is currently trading at a significant discount, especially when considering the several growth catalysts that will unfold in both the short and long term. At the moment, CrowdStrike is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23x, which is well below its five-year historical average of 29x. This disparity may suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its historical valuation, presenting a unique buying opportunity for investors. In the near term, I anticipate that CrowdStrike's stock may experience some additional drawdowns as investors reassess their positions in light of the recent outage. However, I view this as a temporary phase, which could provide a compelling entry point for those who may have missed out on the stock during its earlier growth stages.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
CRWD Data by GuruFocus
Historically, CrowdStrike's P/S ratio has been considerably higher, so I expect that as the company fully recovers from the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) incident, its valuation will revert closer to the five-year average of 29x. Given these factors, I'm setting a target multiple of 27x, which would imply a price target of around $375 per share. This represents an upside of approximately 20%, which, in my opinion, provides a solid margin for investors to take advantage of at current levels.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
[Alpha Spread]
From a discounted cash flow (DCF) perspective, I used a discount rate of 8% (which reflects the company's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC) and applied a conservative terminal growth rate of 5%. This DCF analysis aligns with Wall Street's growth forecasts for CrowdStrike over the next five years, which reflects a topline-growth rate of 15% over the next five years and some operating leverage improvements as the company expands beyond endpoint protection and solidifies its position as a leader in platform consolidation, offering a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity services. The scalability and robustness of the Falcon platform have already been proven, supporting the optimistic outlook from analysts. Based on this DCF model, I derive an upside of roughly 19% (with a target price of $408), which I believe offers ample margin for value investors seeking to capitalize on CrowdStrike's current valuation. Given the company's strong fundamentals, its recovery potential, and the broader market opportunity, I see this as an attractive entry point for those looking to invest at these levels.
Conclusion
Despite the recent outage and its immediate challenges, I remain confident in CrowdStrike's long-term growth potential. The company's current market position, and the strategy towards platform consolidation positions it well to capitalize on the growing trend of enterprise customers seeking to streamline their cybersecurity solutions with a single provider to save costs and improve efficiency. Even after the setback (with regards to BSOD), CrowdStrike secured significant deals, demonstrating resilience and maintaining market trust. Additionally, with its current valuation appearing attractive compared to historical averages, a robust balance sheet, and a proven ability to drive growth through its Falcon platform, I see this as a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on its recovery and long-term market potential.

20241120,CRWD,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).
CrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 6.7% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.
ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank
In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.
Story Continues
The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.
Is CRWD a Good Investment?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.65.
Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike.

Market participants will be closely following the financial results of CrowdStrike Holdings in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on November 26, 2024. On that day, CrowdStrike Holdings is projected to report earnings of $0.82 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $982.26 million, up 24.97% from the prior-year quarter.
Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion, indicating changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, compared to the previous year.
Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for CrowdStrike Holdings. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Our research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD)
If you've ever surfed the web, you have likely used a website that uses CrowdStrike to keep the site secure. Since its IPO in 2019, CrowdStrike has established itself as one of the world's most recognizable cloud-based cybersecurity companies. Back then, its shares traded for only $34, but today, a share in CrowdStrike will set you back a hefty $336.
CrowdStrike occupies a large market share, largely because it's one of the few cybersecurity companies that provide its services via cloud apps instead of directly installing applications like DVDs. This approach allows Crowdstrike's biggest clients, many of which are tech companies or have extensive Web-based operations, to keep the same service as their operations expand.
Crowdstrike's reputation hit in the summer when it experienced a global outage that knocked some of the world's biggest tech companies offline. Despite that, the company's public filings show that CrowdStrike became profitable in 2024. More importantly, analysts expect this stock's earnings per share (EPS) to grow by over 70% by 2027. If CrowdStrike hits those targets, this stock price may shoot so high that a split becomes a strong possibility.

MongoDB's IPO was in 2017 when shares in this tech company cost only $24. Today, MongoDB shares have surged to nearly $280 and its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 40% from 2018 to 2024. Although the company has yet to turn a profit, analysts at Barclays and Citigroup have recently upgraded their price targets for MongoDB to $345 and $400. If the analyst predictions are correct, MongoDB shares could be primed for a split.

ASML (Nasdaq: ASML)
Semiconductors are mission-critical components in AI applications and ASML is a global leader in manufacturing lithography systems fo semiconductors superconductors. These systems work by using advanced optics to imprint circuit patterns onto microchips. This Dutch-based company counts some of the world's foremost tech companies, including Samsung and Intel as its clients.
ASML's Q3 2024 report showed a nearly 60% increase over Q3 2023 and company management predicted revenue would exceed $63 billion by 2030. This company has been around since 1995 and its stock has split four times. The last one came in 2007, but ASML's share price has jumped by nearly 1,500% to the current price of $658.63. Another bonus for ASML shareholders is that it pays a dividend of 0.098% ($6.45/share).
Considering this stock's previous history of splitting and its current sky-high share price, it's not hard to imagine ASML getting set for another split at some point in the future. In the meantime, analysts at JP Morgan and Wells Fargo have given ASML a ""buy now"" rating. The buy-in isn't cheap, but the prospect of earning a dividend and a future stock split makes ASML worth some attention from tech investors.

20241120,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 26% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Check out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings
How To Calculate Return On Equity?
The formula for ROE is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for CrowdStrike Holdings is:
6.0% = US$175m ÷ US$2.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.
What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
CrowdStrike Holdings' Earnings Growth And 6.0% ROE
On the face of it, CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that CrowdStrike Holdings grew its net income at a significant rate of 28% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
We then compared CrowdStrike Holdings' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period.

20241120,CRWD,"Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.
What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for CrowdStrike Holdings, this is the formula:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.012 = US$53m ÷ (US$7.2b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).
Thus, CrowdStrike Holdings has an ROCE of 1.2%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 9.0%.
See our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings
NasdaqGS:CRWD Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024
In the above chart we have measured CrowdStrike Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CrowdStrike Holdings for free.
What Can We Tell From CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE Trend?
The fact that CrowdStrike Holdings is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 1.2% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 439% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.
Our Take On CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE
In summary, it's great to see that CrowdStrike Holdings has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CrowdStrike Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.

CRWD stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry and the S&P 500 index’s rise of 16.2% and 10%, respectively, in the past three months. It has also fared better than other cybersecurity players, including Palo Alto Networks PANW, CyberArk Software CYBR and Check Point Software CHKP.

This outperformance has made investors wonder if this is the right time to buy or hold CRWD stock and wait for more stability. Here’s why maintaining a hold strategy could be the most prudent move.
Resilience in CRWD’s Financial Performance Post Outage
CrowdStrike’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company’s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.
The company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm’s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.
This robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike’s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company’s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.
CrowdStrike’s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation
CrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.
The Falcon platform’s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike’s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.
Story Continues
CrowdStrike’s Market Position and Customer Loyalty
CrowdStrike’s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm’s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.
Moreover, the company's “Falcon Flex” subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.
Navigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike
Despite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company’s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management’s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.
Analysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.

Potential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike’s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.
CrowdStrike’s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern
CrowdStrike’s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry’s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.

Conclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now
While CrowdStrike’s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.
CrowdStrike’s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241120,CRWD,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Performing Cybersecurity Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.
Data Breaches to Disruptions
The technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025—a 300% increase from 2015 levels.
A Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.
AI Meets Cybercrime
As AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.
AI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. “Cyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,” noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.
Nonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 “will be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,” yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI’s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively—closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.

The constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)
Year-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.
Earlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike’s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn’t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.
CrowdStrike’s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon’s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.
ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.”
Overall, CRWD ranks 6th on our list of  best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241120,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
CrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
CrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

20241120,CRWD,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.
Is Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?
On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.
Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.
McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.
McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.”
On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.
Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions.
He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta.
Story Continues
As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments.

As NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market—and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO).
What To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry.
Broadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers—critical components for Nvidia’s AI-focused operations.

This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.
A strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.
Historically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia’s during major market reactions. Nvidia’s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.
How To Buy AVGO Stock
By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.
Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.
If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

Economic data releases and earnings
Chip stocks are down 3% since the election. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure.
Once the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months.
Nvidia (NVDA) earnings — coming after the bell Wednesday — will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally.

Tom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday.
""It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,"" said Essaye. ""It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.""
Nvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock — up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years — hit record highs following the election.
But many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.
Semiconductor returns during the second half of 2024
The worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.
Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor — is down 14%.
The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous.

To be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday.
""Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],"" said Essaye.
Since the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia — ""priced to perfection"" according to many analysts — underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.
Story Continues
But Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this ""bellwether"" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.
""They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far,"" he said. ""I think they can do it again.""

20241120,AVGO,"We recently compiled a list of the Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.
When it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there’s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University’s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).
Founded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university’s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard’s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard’s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university’s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard’s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.
According to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia’s 11.5% or Brown’s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC’s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:
“In FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC’s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.”
Notably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from ""overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500."" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar’s strategy of overhauling the university’s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Harvard Management Company's Stake: $89.6 million
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the world’s largest technology companies, with operations spanning the hardware and software sectors. The company’s primary strength is in hardware, as it supplies networking and custom chips across diverse applications.
In its third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and robust non-AI semiconductor sales. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI revenue to grow 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the annual AI revenue to $12 billion, largely fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.
On November 6, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company’s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing “seasonal headwinds” linked to a product transition for Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.
Overall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's ""easy"" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some ""serious gains.""
""I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It’s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don’t count. But that, people, is nonsense.""
Cramer said banks do not ""care"" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.
""I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I’m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.""

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.
The company’s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“We continued to build our position in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers – such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few – will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA’s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.”
Overall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

20241120,AVGO,"Broadcom: 3 Reasons We Love This Stock
Broadcom currently trades at $165.14 and has been a dream stock for shareholders. It’s returned 431% since November 2019, blowing past the S&P 500’s 87.9% gain. The company has also beaten the index over the past six months as its stock price is up 16.8%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.
Is now still a good time to buy AVGO? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it’s free.
Why Is AVGO a Good Business?
Originally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.
1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum
A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Over the last five years, Broadcom grew its sales at an excellent 16% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).
Broadcom Quarterly Revenue
2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable
Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.
Broadcom’s management team is currently guiding for a 50.6% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect Broadcom’s revenue to grow 24.6% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus its 21.6% annualized growth rate for the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and implies its newer products and services will catalyze higher growth rates.
3. Excellent Free Cash Flow Boosts Reinvestment Potential
Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.
Broadcom has shown terrific cash profitability, and if sustainable, puts it in an advantageous position to invest in new products, return capital to investors, and consolidate the market during industry downturns. The company’s free cash flow margin was among the best in the semiconductor sector, averaging an eye-popping 43.8% over the last two years.

These are just a few reasons why we think Broadcom is a great business, and with its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 28.2x forward price-to-earnings (or $165.14 per share).

20241120,AVGO,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this chipmaker have returned -8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Broadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 points to a change of +14% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Broadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Broadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Nvidia (NVDA) mania is heating up ahead of the market darling's earnings report on Wednesday.
The company is “representative of the most important stocks in America,” EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below).
Jackson reiterated his call that Nvidia's stock could double within the next 12 months given its wide lead in artificial intelligence chip production.
“The investments [in AI] are just getting started,” Jackson added. “The need for these chips is still going to continue for the next year or two or three.”
Nvidia's stock has surged more than 2,600% in the past five years, according to Yahoo Finance data, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabbed the top position in cutting-edge chips.
The company's strong performance is expected to continue in its fiscal third quarter — sales and profits are each estimated to be up 83% from a year ago. Wall Street remains bullish on its favorite stock.

Of the 63 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 59 rate the stock a Buy or Strong Buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. The average price target stands at $160.38, about 13% above current levels.
""We see the near-term risks as largely balanced and we are buyers of Nvidia heading into its fiscal third quarter earnings report scheduled for Wednesday,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a client note on Monday. ""Positive set-up indicators from accelerating bookings at cloud service providers, an upward bias on hyper-scale capital expenditures, as well as our view that near-term estimates will increase post the earnings call.""
Lipacis said that if Nvidia were to let investors down, it would come in the form of decelerating revenue growth.

There has been a whirlwind of activity around Nvidia as of late.
In addition to achieving the world's most valuable company status by nudging out Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG), Nvidia joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Nov. 8. Former chip leader Intel (INTC) was kicked out.
“It’s good that Nvidia is part of the mix now,” Jackson said, noting it could encourage purchases from retail investors.
One potential hiccup is the restrictions around selling to China by the Biden administration and subsequent write-downs, which were a “meaningful part of their quarterly earnings,” Jackson said. “They had to take it down to zero.”

Incoming president Donald Trump could stay firm on the chip issue as well, making good on his campaign promises around China.
""The good news for investors is that they’ve written everything down and so if anything comes from the relationship with China and Nvidia, it’s going to be great,” Jackson said.
Wall Street will be hard-pressed to downgrade Nvidia's stock in the medium term.

20241120,AVGO,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Predictive Analytics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.
Data is at the forefront of many inventions today and is the primary ingredient of innovation. Of the many branches of data usage, predictive analytics is garnering immense traction, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistics, modeling, and machine learning to forecast, predict, and plan future events. There are different types of predictive analytics including regression analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms.
According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics market was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023. The global predictive analytics market is expected to grow to $95.3 billion by 2032 from $18.02 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%. The report attributes the growth in the industry to the growing investments in data by the government and large corporations followed by IoT and AI integrations. The use of predictive analytics is bifurcated into multiple segments including life sciences, automotive, retail, energy, telecom, and healthcare, to name a few.
Startups Disrupting the Predictive Analytics Space
There are a range of startups in the predictive analytics space that are revolutionizing the industry. One such name is Pecan AI. The automated predictive analytics platform is developed and designed intricately to meet the needs of data scientists. Data scientists can use the platform to build powerful predictive AI capabilities and machine learning models that drive business impact. Data scientists do not need coding or data science skills to make use of the platform. The platform is used by a range of companies including Johnson & Johnson, SciPlay, Hydrant, Kenvue, Proper Cloth, and DME Acquire. Earlier in January, the company introduced predictive generative AI to transform enterprises. Pecan AI also has partnerships with some of the largest tech corporations and platforms including Azure and AWS.
DataRobot is another leader in the predictive analytics industry that delivers revolutionary AI use cases for businesses. Its AI platform consists of core AI features such as generative AI, predictive AI, AI governance, AI observability, and AI foundation. The platform promises 83% faster deployment and secures nearly 1.4 billion predictions every day. Users can run models in minutes by skipping manual data preparation and cleaning. Additionally, the platform eliminates the need for repetitive coding, by streamlining feature discovery and defining elements of datasets automatically. Users can connect data from warehouses such as AWS and Azure into a singular workspace. Some of the predictive use cases facilitated by DataRobot include time series modeling, clustering and seasonality, cold start forecasting, nowcasting, and anomaly detection.

20241120,AVGO,"It's been a soft week for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares, which are down 10%. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been spectacular. To be precise, the stock price is 423% higher than it was five years ago, a wonderful performance by any measure. So it might be that some shareholders are taking profits after good performance. The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain.
While the stock has fallen 10% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.
See our latest analysis for Broadcom
In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Over half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.5% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 39% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 140.31.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
NasdaqGS:AVGO Earnings Per Share Growth November 16th 2024
Dive deeper into Broadcom's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Broadcom's earnings, revenue and cash flow.
What About Dividends?
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Broadcom's TSR for the last 5 years was 507%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
A Different Perspective
We're pleased to report that Broadcom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 71% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 43%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.

GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.
AI Frenzy Remains Intact
The astonishing rally of U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative AI technology across the world was the prime factor.
Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending will increase from $67 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. UBS estimated that four U.S. technology giants that are member of the so-called “magnificent 7” will spend around $267 billion as capital expenditure on AI applications in 2025, a jump of 33.5% year over year.

On July 24, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model.

20241120,NOW,"ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
ROE can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:
14% = US$1.3b ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.
What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
ServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE
To start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.
NYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.

Is ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?
ServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Conclusion
On the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

20241120,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:
“When it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.”

Cramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.
Another sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.
While some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.
Similarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they’re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.
As for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they’ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.

“We need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we’re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.”

Cramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.’s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:
“Let's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive… Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market… Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting… Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again… Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.
Additionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company’s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.
Overall NOW ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

Sovereign AI: a new concept gaining traction in the realm of artificial intelligence. As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing “sovereign” artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to “codify” a country’s culture, history, and collective intelligence.

That said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent’s competitiveness and technological resilience.
Filippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they “understand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.”
“As this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.”
While AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.
Latest Advancements in AI
In recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon’s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe’s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world’s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.
“WoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification”.
Story Continues
Other fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.
In other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed “Operator”, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. The planned release is part of a wider industry movement towards agents—AI software capable of performing multi-step tasks for users with minimal oversight.

20241120,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.
Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday’s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there’s a catch.
“What if the Treasury doesn’t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.”
READ ALSO Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks and Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins
Even though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.
Cramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump’s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board—on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains—no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it’s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:
“If it’s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses… It has always worked for the stock market.”
But Cramer warned that there’s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market’s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.
Story Continues
“If you believe we’re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.”

How ServiceNow Inc (NOW)’s AI Partnerships Are Driving Its Soaring Growth: Insights from Jim Cramer
A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.
ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)
Talking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:
“As is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn’t make a lot of sense and… we’re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company’s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia’s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.
This partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.
For the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%. The company also expects a gross profit margin of 84.5% for its subscription services, with an operating income margin of 29.5% and a free cash flow margin of 31%.
Overall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks.

20241120,NOW,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL –November 15, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Toast TOST, as the Bull of the Day and Clean Harbors CLH, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Toast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.
The stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock’s ongoing upward momentum.
About the Company
Toast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.
With its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.
Its platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.
Toast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.
The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “A” in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a “F” in Value.
Q3 Earnings Beat
On November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.
Q3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.
The company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.
Gross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.
Management comments were overwhelmingly bullish:
“Toast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.”
Estimates Headed Higher
Analysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.
Story Continues
For the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.
For the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.
For the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.
Toast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote
With the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.
JPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.
The Technical Take
The stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO’d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.
After trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.
With the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.
Post earnings low: $36
Gap fill: $33
21-day: $32
50-day: $29.20
200-day: $25.20
Fibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32
While that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.
In Summary
Toast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.
The company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.
As Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.
Bear of the Day:
Clean Harbors  is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.
The company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?
With an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.
About the Company
Clean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).
The company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world’s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.
CLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “D” in Value, But “B” in both Momentum and Growth.
Q3 Earnings
The company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.
Despite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.
Positive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.
While there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.
Earnings Estimates
Estimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.
For the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.
Looking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.
For the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year’s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.
Technical Take
The drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.
This volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.
The drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.
The stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.
In Summary
Clean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.
With significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.

NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.
The strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.
In third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.
NOW’s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation
However, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.
In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector’s 6.37X.
We believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow’s premium valuation.
Conclusion
ServiceNow’s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.
ServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241120,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.
Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ to discuss the market’s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we’ve had some ""very good"" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.

Hickey’s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.
Developments in the AI Landscape
With AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn’t anyone who doesn’t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the “Future 40”. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.
Artificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure”, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China’s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act “as ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.”
Story Continues
As per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden’s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments “to give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure”, amongst other things.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Strong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive

NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.

The strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.

20241120,NOW,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
ServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
Story Continues
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Should You Invest in NOW?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

20241120,NOW,"Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
ServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.
Insiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).
ServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock
The last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.
Insider Ownership Of ServiceNow
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?
Insiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for ServiceNow you should be aware of.

One conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC’s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.

Nevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity’s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn’t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.
While that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.
“The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever”.
In light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called ""time testing compute"" for improving models during the “inference” phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.
Recent AI Developments
Fortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry’s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.
Story Continues
In its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn’t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot’s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.
In other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.
“Ad programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.”

20241120,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Will Go Higher in Trump Presidency. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer.
In a recent program, Jim Cramer celebrated the market’s rally on Donald Trump’s election victory, saying the market likes Trump.
“The market likes Donald J. Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?”
Cramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.
“Trump wants to cut taxes—all taxes—including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It’s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that’s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.”
Cramer said the market is still “oversold” as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground. However, Cramer said the polls were again proved wrong.
Cramer then talked about the stocks that investors can buy to ride the Trump rally.

20241120,NOW,"ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
Story Continues
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
ServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
ServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

20241120,NOW,"ServiceNow Customer Service Management and Five9 Intelligent CX Platform to streamline self-service and assisted service operations
Integrated solution to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction
TORONTO & BARCELONA, Spain, November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow World Forum & Five9 CX Summit—ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, and Five9 (NASDAQ: FIVN), provider of the Intelligent CX Platform, today announced an expanded partnership to deliver a turnkey AI-powered solution for unified end-to-end employee and customer experiences. By combining the strengths of ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) and the Five9 platform, the solution will create more streamlined self-service and assisted service operations and unify customer support processes to reduce operational costs, increase agent efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and simplify contact center operations.
""Organizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together,"" said John Ball, senior vice president, Customer and Industry Workflows at ServiceNow. ""ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self-service and assisted service across voice and digital channels. Our expanded partnership with Five9 takes this even further, combining the best of both platforms to streamline and unify contact center operations with a turnkey solution that’s fast to deploy and delivers fast ROI.""
""Five9’s longstanding partnership with ServiceNow has been rooted in the joint mission to create seamless and powerful end-to-end customer experiences,"" said Callan Schebella, executive vice president, product management, Five9. ""This next phase of our partnership transforms the approach to customer experience management, alleviating a lot of the frustrations that come with using multiple systems to address customer needs. We’ve taken a big step forward to empower customers with our joint AI capabilities and improved interface functionality, easing the day-to-day challenges of customer-facing service.""
""Combining the most valuable features into a unified interface can transform the way we support our customers,"" said Bob Massengill, senior director, Technology Infrastructure, Pilot Travel Centers, LLC. ""This new ServiceNow-Five9 joint solution has the potential to enable us to address customer needs more quickly and effectively.""
Story Continues
The new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.
Real-time Transcription – Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents’ work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.
Unified Routing – Five9’s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9. This reduces operational overhead for managers through streamlined routing management across both systems, making it easier to adjust staffing during high-demand periods. It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.
Single Agent Experience – Native Call Controls within ServiceNow’s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer’s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.
Availability
The ServiceNow and Five9 integrated capabilities are expected to be available to select customers in the first half of 2025.

New Now Assist capabilities drive greater visibility and controls with AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices
Native multilingual support extends global footprint for seamless, culturally aware GenAI communications and translations
Purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety
SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, today announced new generative AI (GenAI) and governance innovations to advance autonomous, responsible AI on the Now Platform. With this launch, ServiceNow is adding more than 150 GenAI innovations to its portfolio for customers. This includes new, expanded Now Assist capabilities that drive greater visibility and controls with an AI Governance offering for secure and compliant AI practices. Native multilingual support in Now Assist extends GenAI’s global footprint for seamless, culturally aware communications and translations. Finally, purpose-built solutions deliver new Now Assist use cases for configuration management, contract management, legal services, and health and safety.
As enterprises have accelerated the adoption of GenAI, they are discovering that siloed applications and scattered data are barriers to impact and that establishing clearly defined, human-centric governance processes are essential to the effective use and oversight of GenAI. That’s why ServiceNow delivers a winning combination of one platform with an integrated data layer and continues to optimize its AI platform for speed, scale, and security. The single architecture of the Now Platform helps ensure strong governance is embedded in its Now Assist GenAI solutions, models, and agents no matter where they are deployed in an organization.
""Enterprises across every industry are embracing a future of greater autonomy and productivity, all in service to their employees, customers, and overall business impact,"" said Jon Sigler, senior vice president of Platform and AI at ServiceNow. ""The ServiceNow platform was built to empower this transformation, offering smarter, faster ways of working through AI-enabled automation. With governance at the core, these new innovations bring more personalized, collaborative, trusted experiences to life across the enterprise.""
Elevating customer trust with integrated AI governance
Teams working with AI are often burdened with siloed tools and systems, making visibility and AI governance difficult. AI governance requires the integration of complex business processes and needs a best-of-breed workflow platform to be implemented successfully. With a unified AI inventory data model for connecting AI strategy, technology, security, and compliance to operate as an AI control tower, and expanded oversight for AI Governance for Now Assist, ServiceNow is laying a foundation to help customers build trust while accelerating business transformation.
Story Continues
ServiceNow also introduced new Now Assist capabilities that empower customers with the tools needed for responsible AI use:
Now Assist Guardian provides built-in monitoring and responsible AI guardrails so customers can better control the use of GenAI on the Now Platform. This includes the management and mitigation of offensive content, security vulnerabilities, and the exposure of sensitive information.
Now Assist Data Kit eases the often-cumbersome task of managing and consuming data for AI use cases. Users can create and easily manage datasets for AI skills and applications, develop ground truth datasets to benchmark for accuracy and help predict AI outcomes, and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of experiences built with Now Assist Skill Kit.
Now Assist Analytics offers greater visibility into the adoption, usage, and performance of Now Assist across the enterprise. With these insights, customers can make more informed, data-driven decisions to advance GenAI adoption, evaluate ROI on GenAI investments, and enable better business outcomes.
Extending the value and impact of GenAI globally
With today’s launch, ServiceNow is adding new built-in multilingual features to Now Assist. These new features address customer demand and expand the application of ServiceNow’s GenAI solutions in global markets. Now Assist can now generate, summarize, and respond to GenAI prompts in the user’s native language, providing improved, culturally aware understanding and communication for both agents and requestors.
The following languages are supported natively by Now Assist: English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese. Other languages will continue to be supported with ServiceNow’s existing Dynamic Translation, which automatically translates user inputs and a response back in the user’s language.
Accelerating productivity with tailored Now Assist solutions
Building on the Xanadu platform release—which marked the company’s most comprehensive set of AI innovations to date—ServiceNow has further expanded Now Assist solutions, purpose-built for specific enterprise use cases. From configuration management to legal affairs and health and safety, GenAI can help transform the productivity and efficacy of these critical internal functions.
Now Assist for Configuration Management Database (CMDB) uses AI to make managing and understanding data easier for customers. It helps users keep a clean and accurate CMDB by reducing duplicate data, simplifying complex information, and streamlining data input. With Now Assist for CMDB, users can quickly view summaries of Configuration Items (CIs) and their dependencies, and AI can find and fix duplicate data automatically. It also assists in the setup of Service Graph Connectors to bring data into the CMDB and fix any issues that come up during the process.
Now Assist for Legal Service Delivery helps legal teams deliver faster service to clients with auto-generated summaries of legal requests and matters. Legal teams are often juggling multiple requests and complex legal matters, such as investigations, simultaneously. With Now Assist, they can fulfill these requests with greater efficiency and faster time to resolution.
Now Assist in Contract Management streamlines contract processing and reduces risk by leveraging GenAI to automatically flag non-standard language, identify missing clauses and suggest revisions within contracts such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Additionally, GenAI provides rapid insights into contractual terms and obligations by intelligently extracting metadata from contracts. This helps reduce cost, revenue leakage, and risk for the enterprise.
Now Assist for Health and Safety helps ensure a safer environment for employees by streamlining incident management processes while reducing manual, repetitive work for health and safety workers. It uses GenAI to auto-generate summaries of safety incidents and lessons learned based on incident records, resulting in more effective communication, improved agent productivity, and proactive prevention and resolution of incidents.
In addition to these new innovations, ServiceNow Impact—the ServiceNow customer success solution to maximize AI, optimize performance, provide on-demand expertise, and accelerate business value—includes new GenAI accelerators to help make adoption of Now Assist solutions easier and faster for customers.
""Worldwide spending on AI is projected to grow 3 times greater than the five-year CAGR for worldwide IT spending over the same period (2023-2028), driven by the rapid infusion of AI and GenAI for employee experience, customer engagement, business processes, and industry innovation,"" said Ritu Jyoti, general manager/group VP, AI, and Data market research and advisory at IDC. ""As organizations look to drive value from AI transformations, they recognize the need for a single and scalable platform that connects people, processes, data, and systems. ServiceNow is meeting customers where they are by streamlining workflows and simplifying complex processes on a single AI-powered platform. As ServiceNow expands GenAI into new areas of the enterprise, the company continues to help organizations transform operations and stay competitive.""
Customers like EY are already seeing the benefits of Now Assist.
""GenAI is having a huge impact on our organization, both in the way EY teams deliver EY services and support EY people, but also in creating opportunities to go to market with ServiceNow to help EY clients transform their businesses,"" said Hank Prybylski, Global Vice Chair, Transformation, EY. ""We are seeing incredible value in the Now Assist space and looking to extend that to a whole suite of areas including customer service management and more broadly to our managed services environment.""
Putting data and AI to work across the Now Platform
On top of today’s launch, ServiceNow recently announced Workflow Data Fabric, a breakthrough innovation that enhances all ServiceNow workflows, AI solutions, and AI Agents.
This enhanced, integrated data layer allows customers to connect, understand, and act on structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data across the enterprise, inside and outside of ServiceNow. Coupled with zero copy capabilities and the future integration of Knowledge Graph, which transforms raw data into contextual insights, ServiceNow is unifying people, processes, operations, and systems so AI can work more autonomously across the enterprise.
These data capabilities are an instrumental part of ServiceNow's vision of AI Agents that work autonomously and collaboratively with people to enable business transformation. This vision also includes the expansion of its partnership with NVIDIA to jointly develop AI agent use cases on the Now Platform and accelerate the adoption of Agentic AI, reinventing how AI delivers value across all industries.
Availability
AI Governance for Now Assist is available today to a limited set of customers and is expected to be generally available in Q1 2025. All other new GenAI innovations announced today are now generally available to customers in the ServiceNow Store.

20241121,META,"Nvidia (NVDA) is assuaging Wall Street’s concerns about any potential slowdowns in the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip, telling investors during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday that it’s on pace to exceed its previous revenue estimates for the current quarter.
“Blackwell production is in full steam,” CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.”
Prior to the earnings call, The Information reported on Nov. 17 that Nvidia was contending with overheating issues related to its Blackwell-based servers leading suppliers to adjust the design of the racks that house the servers. Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected.
The report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time.
Now Nvidia is saying that the chips aren’t just shipping, they’re in the hands of all of the company’s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker’s data center revenue. Ensuring they’re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia’s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that.

“With any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,” Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance.
“And I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.”
But there’s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth’s chips makes it difficult to meet demand.
“It is the case that demand exceeds supply,” Huang told analysts. “And that’s expected as we’re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.”

For some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.
The H100 is Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.
Story Continues
As Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need.
“Nvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,” New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. “And so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.”
In its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street’s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday.
This isn’t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company’s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.

20241121,META,"Meta Platforms (META, Financials) has hired Clara Shih, the former chief executive of artificial intelligence at Salesforce (CRM, Financials), to lead its new artificial intelligence business tools division, Jefferies said on Wednesday.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.
The action represents a major turn in Meta's attempts to profit from its platform ecosystem by use of artificial intelligence.
Shih's expertise leading the development of Agentforce at Salesforcewhere she oversaw more than 200 million business users across WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebookshould support Meta's efforts to build generative artificial intelligence tools and agents, Jefferies said.
The company pointed out Shih already knows Meta's social environment and platforms. For now, Meta has sold its softwareincluding the Llama AI modelinto business markets, mostly via corporations like Amazon (AMZN, Financials) and Microsoft (MSFT, Financials).
The news coincides with Meta's attempt to extend its artificial intelligence capacity outside of alliances with businesses like Amazon and Microsoft. Previously, Meta used outside software companies to present to business customers its AI solutionsincluding its Llama model. Jefferies said the new subsidiary represents a major turning point in Meta's approach to directly interact with business consumers and profit from open-source AI developments.
Jefferies reiterated a ""buy"" rating for Meta with a price target of $675; META shares are changing hands for $561.75 in Thursday's early market trading, down modestly.

AI stocks are soaring and AI startups are receiving billions in funding from venture capital firms as the new technology sweeps investors off their feet. However, as the AI boom plays out, the central bank in Europe has issued a dire warning about the development of an AI bubble. The warning was included in the biannual Financial Stability Review, a report that lists the risks that could threaten the financial well being of world markets. In the review, the European Central Bank noted that the stock market, particularly in the United States, had become increasingly dependent on a handful of companies perceived as the beneficiaries of the AI boom.

Per the ECB, this concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble. It added that in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointing. The ECB further underlined that investors were demanding a low premium to own shares and bonds while funds had cut their cash buffers. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments, the ECB said.

20241121,META,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.
By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.
However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.
Our proprietary system currently recommends Meta Platforms (META) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this social media company a great growth pick right now.
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 51.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 32.2%.
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.
Right now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.57, it can be said that the company is more efficient.
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 20.8% this year versus the industry average of 7.1%.
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Story Continues
There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.1% over the past month.
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

20241121,META,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Meta Platforms (META) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
Meta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 52 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 52 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 82.7% and 3.9% of all recommendations.
Brokerage Recommendation Trends for META

Check price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>

While the ABR calls for buying Meta Platforms, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR
In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.
Story Continues
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Is META Worth Investing In?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.1% over the past month to $22.53.
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.

20241121,META,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Numenta, a company with backing from the Gates Foundation, on Wednesday released an open-source AI model it hopes will require less energy and data to create intelligent machines than existing technologies.
Numenta was co-founded by Jeff Hawkins, the founder of Palm Computing in the 1990s, which in turn invented the Palm Pilot. Hawkins' deepest academic interest is neuroscience, which showed up in the Palm Pilot's handwriting recognition software that leveraged an earlier era of artificial intelligence.
While most of today's popular AI systems are roughly modeled on human brains with a technology called neural networks, Numenta has a different idea of how the brain works and hopes to persuade AI researchers to try its approach.
Most current AI systems ingest huge amounts of static data - such as massive libraries of text or images - and run that through thousands or even tens of thousands of computing chips. After weeks or months of computing using vast amounts of electricity, the AI system is trained to generate responses to human queries.
Numenta believes that such training can be a more constant process, where brain cells gather small bits of information from senses such as sight and touch and constantly develop models of the world that can be modified on the fly as conditions change, like a young child learning a new toy.
The company says the approach can be applied to robots that learn to navigate the world and other types of knowledge like writing. On Wednesday, it will release open source computer code to let other companies and researchers try its approach.
Other firms such as Meta Platforms have also made their AI technology freely available. That has helped Meta catch up to rivals such as OpenAI, but has also led to the use of Meta's technology by the Chinese military.
Subutai Ahmad, Numenta's chief executive, said the company will closely monitor how its technology is used once it becomes public.
""The technology is still early, and the way we deal with this will depend on the exact way the technology matures,"" Ahmad told Reuters. ""These are important issues that we need to think about.""

He added that San Francisco's problems stem from its inefficient technical infrastructure, leading to delays in hiring and housing approvals, areas where tech executives are well-positioned to contribute.

20241121,AAPL,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is racing to develop a more conversational version of its Siri digital assistant, aiming to catch up with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other voice services, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The new Siri, details of which haven’t been reported, uses more advanced large language models, or LLMs, to allow for back-and-forth conversations, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the effort hasn’t been announced. The system also can handle more sophisticated requests in a quicker fashion, they said.
Revamping the 13-year-old Siri service is part of Apple’s efforts to become a force in artificial intelligence. The company debuted its much-ballyhooed Apple Intelligence platform last month, but it still lacks many of the features offered by other tech giants.
The new voice assistant, which will eventually be added to Apple Intelligence, is dubbed “LLM Siri” by those working on it. LLMs — a building block of generative AI — gorge on massive amounts of data in order to identify patterns and answer questions.
Apple has been testing the upgraded software on iPhones, iPads and Macs as a separate app, but the technology will ultimately replace the Siri interface that users rely on today. The company is planning to announce the overhaul as soon as 2025 as part of the upcoming iOS 19 and macOS 16 software updates, which are internally named Luck and Cheer, the people said.
Like Apple Intelligence this fall, the new features won’t immediately be included in next year’s crop of hardware devices. Instead, Apple is currently planning to release the new Siri to consumers as early as spring 2026, about a year and a half from now. Given that Apple is still several months away from announcing the plan, the timing and features could still shift.
A spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.
The revamped Siri will rely on new Apple AI models to interact more like a human and handle tasks in a way that’s closer to ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. It also will make expanded use of App Intents, which allow for more precise control of third-party apps. And the software will be able to tap into features from Apple Intelligence, such as the ability to write and summarize text.
Story Continues
Though Apple heralded “the start of a new era” for Siri when it first unveiled its AI platform in June, the company has yet to truly overhaul the software. The upgrades that accompanied Apple Intelligence were mostly cosmetic, including a new glowing interface that shows users when they’ve triggered the assistant. There’s also an option to type commands — rather than speaking them — and the ability to better understand users.
Siri will get additional tweaks in the coming months as part of iOS 18, the iPhone’s current operating system. The software will be able to draw on customer data to provide context for commands and take action using the information on a user’s screen. The iOS 18 version relies on a first-generation Apple LLM to determine if requests should use the existing Siri infrastructure or be routed to a second LLM that can handle more complex queries and tap into third-party apps.
The next-generation LLM planned for iOS 19 will be a new, end-to-end system that provides more advanced, ChatGPT-like capabilities.
While the company works on that new technology, it will add ChatGPT to Apple Intelligence next month. Later, Apple plans to offer additional chatbot options, such as Gemini. The idea behind the new Siri is to bring these kinds of capabilities in-house, while emphasizing user privacy. But the company could still continue to offer access to third-party AI systems that provide specialized abilities or information.
In recent weeks, Apple has posted job listings that hint at its plan for a more conversational Siri.
“You will join a team that is redefining computing, creating groundbreaking conversational assistant technologies for both large-scale systems and new client devices, and with the people who built the intelligent assistants,” one listing reads. Others ask for candidates with knowledge in conversational AI interfaces and underlying technologies.
Apple has been looking to give Siri more conversational abilities for several years but struggled to find the right technology. Over a year ago, Apple moved the team responsible for the way Siri interacts with users from the company’s AI division to its group responsible for software interfaces. The team is now led by Alan Dye, the company’s vice president of human interface design.

20241121,AAPL,"Apple's (AAPL, Financial) iPhone 16 sales declined in Indonesia because Apple failed to conform to local production requirements. As a result, the firm has presented an investment plan of $100 million to set up a manufacturing plant in the country. The offer is ten times larger than an earlier $10 million offer to fix the conflict reached by Bloomberg and other outlets.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ELF.
Indonesia has set a rule that about 40% of the components of appliances imported into the country should be manufactured locally to promote local industries. Apple failed to meet this requirement, which saw iPhone 16 sales put on hold a few weeks after its launch in September. The proposed plant, expected to be established in West Java, will mainly concentrate on producing accessories and other components to ensure compliance.
This massive shift highlights the company's future route in the still-growing market in Indonesia, a country in Southeast Asia. It has a population of more than 280 million people and is an attractive market for international technology companies. The investment also corresponds to the company's long-term plan to de-emphasize reliance on Malaysia as a production hub as it diversifies throughout Southeast Asia; prior commitments in Vietnam were made earlier this year.
The Ministry of Industry of Indonesia is scheduled to consider Apple's proposal on Thursday, implicating renewed bargaining. The ban also applied to Alphabet's Google (GOOG, Financial), which encountered the same restrictions with Pixel smartphones. These developments highlight that local production policies increasingly shape the emergence of the international technology landscape and market opportunities.

The closely held company introduced its latest marquee smartphone aimed at global markets, the Find X8, in Bali, Indonesia, on Thursday. The No. 4 phonemaker globally is open to expanding its manufacturing network outside its home market, senior executive Billy Zhang said, stopping short of announcing any specific plans.
“We can quickly fulfill local customers’ needs with our strong manufacturing capability,” Zhang, president of overseas marketing, sales and services, told reporters in a briefing on the resort island. “Indonesian manufacturing is already a part of our system and we’ve hired a lot of local workers.”
Zhang highlighted the critical role of Indonesia for Oppo’s expansion plans, as the largest nation in Southeast Asia pushes multinational companies to invest more and add local manufacturing. Apple Inc. is among smartphone contenders seeking growth in the country of more than 270 million people, increasing its local investment plans to appease the government and persuade it to lift its sales ban on the US firm’s iPhone 16 phones.
Oppo’s rivals in Indonesia also include its Chinese peers Vivo and Xiaomi Corp., all targeting the young and increasingly tech-savvy consumers of Southeast Asia’s largest economy. At home, Oppo has lost steam this year as Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi gained traction.
Oppo has factories in India, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, and Brazil, and it sells through more than 300,000 retail outlets in over 70 markets. Overseas markets contribute about 60% of its smartphone shipments, with Southeast Asia and Latin American countries such as Brazil and Argentina driving the growth, the company said in a statement.

20241121,AAPL,"Apple saw a sharp decrease in iPhone sales across China during this year's Singles' Day, the world's biggest shopping festival, amid stiff competition from mainland smartphone rivals and weak domestic consumption, according to a new report.
The country's two-week Singles' Day sales period this year yielded ""a double-digit, year-on-year decline in iPhone sales"", as Apple ""faced pressure from an abnormally high number"" of new flagship smartphone models that domestic competitors launched just before and during the annual shopping extravaganza, according to a report published on Wednesday by Counterpoint Research.
The report did not provide the exact percentage drop or the fewer number of iPhone sales that Counterpoint tracked during the event's sales period, which ran from October 28 to November 10.

This year's Singles' Day debacle for Apple, which saw iPhone 16 prices slashed as part of online promotions, reflects the continued cutthroat competition in the world's biggest smartphone market, where major Chinese handset vendors have already launched on-device artificial intelligence (AI) ahead of the US tech giant.

Overall, Singles' Day smartphone sales this year fell 9 per cent compared with last year, as market demand and consumers' enthusiasm for promotions have been subdued by economic headwinds, according to the Counterpoint report.
Still, Apple's latest flagship iPhone series has proved popular on the mainland since it hit store shelves in September. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max were the bestselling models during the two-week festival, the report said.
In the same two-week sales period, smartphone sales of Huawei Technologies stood out with an ""impressive growth of 7 per cent year on year"", the report said. Counterpoint attributed that performance to ""generous price cuts"" on Huawei's Pura 70 series and Mate 60 series, as well as the newly launched Nova 13 series with the 5G Kirin processor.
Sales of Oppo rose 6 per cent from last year's Singles' Day festival, while those of Vivo grew 5 per cent.

By contrast, sales of Xiaomi decreased 6 per cent and those of Huawei spin-off Honor fell 15 per cent.

While China's smartphone market is on track to record its first sales growth in five years, according to Counterpoint, Apple has its work cut out after placing out of the top-five domestic rankings in the third quarter.
Chinese smartphone vendors Vivo, Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor and Oppo occupied the top-five domestic rankings, as Apple took the No 6 spot with a 13.5 per cent market share last quarter, a Counterpoint report last month said.
That finding runs counter to an earlier report by research firm IDC, which saw Apple back at the No 2 spot in third-quarter domestic smartphone shipment rankings behind Vivo and ahead of Huawei, Xiaomi and Honor.
As Apple awaits Beijing's approval to launch its AI services on the mainland, competition in the market is set to intensify as Huawei is expected to launch its new Mate 70 smartphone series this month.

Discovery (WBD) and the NBA reaching a lawsuit settlement over sports broadcast rights, FanDuel parent Flutter Entertainment's (FLUT) strong earnings results, and the Formula 1 Grand Prix returning to Las Vegas.
This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano breaks down these top sports headlines.
""Warner Bros. Discovery sued the NBA after losing out on their media rights package earlier this year... Warner Bros. is going to be getting a few additional assets, and the NBA is going to be moving on with its new partner Amazon (AMZN),"" Pompliano explains. ""This is sort of a win-win for everyone because the NBA gets to move on with Amazon. ESPN gets Inside the NBA from Warner Bros. who's going to be licensing them the wildly successful show and Warner Brothers is now going to get to sub-license some college football and college basketball games from ESPN. Again, a win for everyone involved.""

20241121,AMZN,"The Q3 reporting cycle has officially ended for the Mag 7 group following the release of Nvidia’s quarterly results yesterday. The group posted strong growth, though post-earnings reactions weren’t favorable for all.
But reports from Tesla TSLA and Amazon AMZN did spark post-earnings positivity, with shares of each seeing positive price action following their releases.
But what was there to like in each respective release? Let’s take a closer look.
Amazon's AWS Results Impress
Concerning headline figures in Amazon’s quarterly release, the company exceeded both consensus EPS and sales expectations handily. EPS grew a sizable 70% year-over-year, whereas sales of $60 billion reflected an 11% climb from the year-ago period.
However, the real highlight of the results was the AWS results. AWS sales jumped 19% year-over-year to $27.5 billion, matching the same growth pace we saw last quarter. While the growth pace didn’t reflect an acceleration, the results overall confirm underlying momentum.
Further, the profitability picture for AWS jumped higher, with operating income of $9.3 billion well above the $5.4 billion mark in the year-ago period. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s AWS results against our consensus expectations, with the recent $27.5 billion print falling $127 million short.

Like Tesla, analysts raised their earnings expectations for Amazon following the favorable release, with the stock boasting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Overall, the company’s dominant stance in the cloud paints a bright outlook for the company, particularly in the midst of this AI frenzy that we’ve all become accustomed to. AWS is the dominant player in the cloud computing market, flexing a significant market share globally. It provides various services, including computing power, storage, databases, and AI/ML tools.
Tesla Sees Higher Profitability
While EV delivery/production numbers were important, the real highlight of the release that caused shares to perk up was margin expansion, with the company’s gross margin expanding nicely to 19.8% vs. a 17.9% print in the same period last year.
Please note that the chart’s values are calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis.

Notably, Tesla reported its lowest-ever level of cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle throughout the period, which bodes favorably for upcoming periods as well. Analysts have raised their EPS expectations across the board following the release, with the stock now holding the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The stock’s current momentum is undeniable, partly boosted by the recent U.S. election. Growth is expected to resume in its next fiscal year, with our consensus FY25 expectations suggesting 30% EPS growth on 16% higher sales.
Bottom Line
With Nvidia's quarterly release finally out of the way, the Q3 reporting cycle for the broader Mag 7 group has ended. The group overall posted strong growth, though Amazon AMZN and Tesla TSLA were among the few to see post-earnings momentum.
A notable boost in profitability helped vault Tesla shares higher, with the stock also benefiting from the recent U.S. election. The company overall remains the prime selection for EV exposure, with growth expected to return in a big way during its next fiscal year.
A strong showing from AWS in Amazon’s release aided the bullish action post-earnings, with the results reflecting underlying momentum. The company remains a solid pick for the AI frenzy given its dominant cloud computing stance, with an upcoming holiday season also potentially providing near-term tailwinds.

Artificial intelligence businesses have taken Wall Street by storm in the past few months. One of the most notable success stories has been OpenAI, the AI startup that has become the most valuable private firm in the world with a valuation of over $157 billion. However, the company is facing multiple lawsuits regarding the use of data from news publications without attribution. After US-based The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune took the company to court, Indian news publication ANI has also alleged that the ChatGPT creator is using published content without permission to help train the AI chatbot to provide information to users.

Even as it faces these lawsuits, the company is blazing forward with plans to expand the use of the AI chatbot.

This will let users talk to the AI chatbot right from their browser. However, the latest feature will only be available to Plus, Enterprise, Teams, or Edu subscribers, the paid members of ChatGPT.

20241121,AMZN,"Nvidia (NVDA) is assuaging Wall Street’s concerns about any potential slowdowns in the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip, telling investors during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday that it’s on pace to exceed its previous revenue estimates for the current quarter.
“Blackwell production is in full steam,” CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.”
Prior to the earnings call, The Information reported on Nov. 17 that Nvidia was contending with overheating issues related to its Blackwell-based servers leading suppliers to adjust the design of the racks that house the servers. Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected.
The report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time.
Now Nvidia is saying that the chips aren’t just shipping, they’re in the hands of all of the company’s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker’s data center revenue. Ensuring they’re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia’s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that.

“With any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,” Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance.
“And I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.”
But there’s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth’s chips makes it difficult to meet demand.
“It is the case that demand exceeds supply,” Huang told analysts. “And that’s expected as we’re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.”

For some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.
The H100 is Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.
Story Continues
As Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need.
“Nvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,” New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. “And so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.”
In its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street’s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday.
This isn’t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company’s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.

Our proprietary system currently recommends Amazon (AMZN) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this online retailer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 15.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 78.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 26.4%.
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7.1%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8.8%.

Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Amazon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 8.4% over the past month.
Bottom Line
Amazon has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.

20241121,AMZN,"The Retail-Wholesale group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Amazon (AMZN) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.
Amazon is one of 210 individual stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #7 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups, measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group.
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. Amazon is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).
Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN's full-year earnings has moved 8.3% higher. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.
Our latest available data shows that AMZN has returned about 33.5% since the start of the calendar year. At the same time, Retail-Wholesale stocks have gained an average of 24.6%. This means that Amazon is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.
One other Retail-Wholesale stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is D-MARKET Electronic Services & Trading Unsponsored ADR (HEPS). The stock is up 55.6% year-to-date.
For D-MARKET Electronic Services & Trading Unsponsored ADR, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 40% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
Breaking things down more, Amazon is a member of the Internet - Commerce industry, which includes 39 individual companies and currently sits at #59 in the Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks in this group have gained about 31.9% so far this year, so AMZN is performing better this group in terms of year-to-date returns. D-MARKET Electronic Services & Trading Unsponsored ADR is also part of the same industry.
Investors interested in the Retail-Wholesale sector may want to keep a close eye on Amazon and D-MARKET Electronic Services & Trading Unsponsored ADR as they attempt to continue their solid performance.

20241121,AMZN,"(Bloomberg) -- PDD Holdings Inc.’s shares plunged after warning that its profitability will trend downward over time because of intensifying competition in its home market of China.

PDD, which competes with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., said its team was struggling to catch up with unspecified rivals because of a lack of expertise. Executives also reiterated the company’s guidance from August that sales and profit growth will slow going forward. Its stock slid as much as 10% in early US trading.
That downbeat outlook emerged after PDD reported quarterly sales and profit that missed estimates, lending weight to fears that China’s slowdown is hurting its biggest tech companies more than anticipated. The disappointing results highlight how PDD, despite a thriving overseas business anchored by hot shopping app Temu, is grappling with anemic Chinese consumer spending. A quarter ago, PDD issued a surprisingly strong warning about a slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy and talked up challenges including uncertainties in the global environment.
“We will see greater financial impact as we will be disadvantaged against our competitors for some time to come,” PDD Co-Chief Executive Officer Zhao Jiazhen told analysts on a call on Thursday. “Our team of staff is now limited by their past experience and suffers from lack of certain capabilities.”
The Chinese-owned e-commerce platform reported revenue of 99.4 billion yuan ($13.7 billion) in the September quarter, versus the average analyst estimate of 102.8 billion yuan. Net income was 25 billion yuan, compared to a projected 26.6 billion yuan.
PDD’s been spending big on rural markets and Temu to drive its global presence, helping push growth well above that of rivals Alibaba and JD.com Inc. Temu became one of the most downloaded US apps after a splashy 2022 debut, and has begun challenging even Amazon.com Inc. in certain segments.
But Temu is also encountering growing scrutiny following its meteoric rise overseas.
The European Union has opened an investigation into the e-commerce platform, looking into whether the company is doing enough to combat sales of illegal products. The EU said it suspects the company is violating its new Digital Services Act, a law aimed at stamping out illegal content and disinformation online. It’s also unclear how a Trump administration will wield tariffs as a political tool, potentially disrupting the cross-border trade on which Temu depends.
Story Continues
“There’s uncertainty on potential tariff change and increasing pushback from more countries related to its ‘cheap’ prices,” Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap wrote ahead of the results. “While still growing robustly, Temu is also facing multiple headwinds.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
PDD’s first non-GAAP operating profit miss in seven quarters, 12% below consensus estimates for 3Q, may trigger earning cuts of at least 10% through 2025, assuming revenue rise 20% next year vs. about 62% annually from 2021-24. The 61 basis point operating-margin gain in 3Q vs. 1H’s 8.9 percentage points jump raises the risk that rising rivalry from peers such as Alibaba, Amazon and TikTok Shop will hurt profitability in 2025.
- Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analysts
Click here for the research.
At home, the company in past years has combined low prices with aggressive rural expansion and game-like elements on its platform to grab market share from Alibaba and JD. Those two rivals have recently begun to team up on logistics and payments.
It’s also grappling with a consumer and merchant backlash. Sellers are pushing back against PDD’s low-pricing strategy, as well as policies that allow shoppers to get refunds without returning goods. Over the summer, hundreds of merchants staged a rally outside its offices in southern China, protesting what they called unfair penalties on their businesses.
Nongfu Spring’s founder Zhong Shanshan, China’s richest man, this week publicly called out PDD’s pricing system. PDD’s shares have tumbled since peaking in August, when founder Colin Huang briefly surpassed Zhong to become China’s richest person.

20241121,AMZN,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Amazon (AMZN).
Amazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.10, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 50 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.10 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 50 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 46 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 92% and 6% of all recommendations.

While the ABR calls for buying Amazon, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.
ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Story Continues
It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.
On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Is AMZN Worth Investing In?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8.4% over the past month to $5.17.
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors.

20241121,NFLX,"Netflix's NFLX transformation from a DVD rental service to a streaming giant is taking another significant leap with its ambitious push into live content. The company's recent successes with events like the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match, which drew 108 million average viewers, demonstrate its potential in the live streaming arena. However, technical challenges during these events raise questions about the platform's readiness for major live programming.
Technical Infrastructure Concerns
Netflix's strategic expansion into live streaming, marked by high-profile events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the $5 billion WWE deal, demonstrates its commitment to diversifying content offerings beyond traditional streaming. However, widespread streaming issues and buffering problems plagued many viewers. These technical difficulties are particularly concerning as the company prepares for even bigger events, including two NFL Christmas Day games and the upcoming launch of WWE's Monday Night Raw in 2025.

The platform's ability to handle large-scale concurrent streaming remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed. Despite these short-term hurdles, Netflix's strong market position, growing advertising business and comprehensive entertainment strategy suggest long-term potential. However, given the significant investments required and execution risks in live programming, investors might benefit from waiting for stronger evidence of successful implementation before increasing exposure.
Strategic Content Acquisitions
Netflix's $5 billion deal with WWE for Monday Night Raw represents a significant investment in live programming. Combined with NFL games and special events featuring major entertainers like Beyoncé, the company is positioning itself as a comprehensive entertainment destination. This diversification strategy could help Netflix maintain its competitive edge in an increasingly crowded streaming landscape.

Netflix expects paid net additions to be higher sequentially in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects substantial growth in paid subscribers, with total paid memberships expected to reach 290.54 million by the end of 2024, indicating an 11.6% year-over-year increase.
Financial Implications and Growth Prospects
The company expects revenues to grow in the range of 11-13% in 2025, reaching $43-$44 billion. This growth rate represents a slowdown from the 15% expected in 2024. Netflix's investment in live content and infrastructure improvements may pressure margins in the short term, though management targets a 28% operating margin for 2025.

With total debt reaching $15.98 billion and streaming content obligations at $22.7 billion, Netflix faces significant financial commitments.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $38.91 billion, indicating 15.37% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $19.78 per share, indicating a substantial 64.42% increase from the previous year.

The recent surge in Netflix's stock price has led to expanded valuation multiples, potentially limiting future upside for investors. The company's forward 12-month sales multiple of 8.73 exceeds its five-year median of 6.53, indicating that the stock may be trading at a premium to its historical valuation. Moreover, this multiple surpasses the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward earnings multiple of 3.4, suggesting that Netflix's valuation is stretched relative to its peers.

Market Position and Competition
As traditional media companies increasingly bundle their services, Netflix is taking a different approach by expanding its standalone offering. The addition of live sports and entertainment could help justify future price increases and reduce churn. However, the technical challenges and high costs associated with live programming present risks.

Investors have responded enthusiastically to Netflix's performance, with NFLX shares returning an impressive 81.5% year to date, significantly outperforming tech giants like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.

Investment Outlook
While Netflix's push into live streaming shows promise, current investors should maintain their positions but new investors might want to wait for a better entry point. The company needs to prove that it can consistently deliver high-quality live streaming experiences before the market fully prices in this growth opportunity. Additionally, the significant investments required for live content rights and technical infrastructure may impact near-term profitability.
Conclusion
Netflix's venture into live streaming represents both an opportunity and a challenge. While the strategy could strengthen its market position, technical hurdles and high costs suggest caution. Current shareholders should remain invested to benefit from the company's long-term potential, but new investors might find better entry points after Netflix demonstrates consistent execution in live programming delivery.

20241121,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX, Financial) is in trouble with the law over the much-hyped live stream of the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match, which is said to have been riddled with major issues. A Florida-based person named Ronald Blue Denton sued Netflix in state court for what he considered a shoddy performance in delivering the event to its clients in sharp craving, stating that Netflix was unstoppably ill-equipped for the demand for the show, making it unwatchable.
The lawsuit alleges that Netflix violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and breached the parties' contract while also demanding monetary damages and a class action on behalf of other affected Netflix subscribers. According to Denton, Netflix is guilty of abdicating its role as a service provider since it failed to provide a perfect viewing experience for millions of people.
The November 15 fight that Netflix promoted as its primary sports event attracted 108 million viewers worldwide. Nonetheless, many people used social networks to complain about the declining video quality, numerous instances of buffering, and completely frozen streams, especially if the moment in the match was important.
Netflix included the topic as part of a significant milestone in sports streaming to establish its dominance in the live segment. Denton's lawsuit now appears to potentially overshadow the feat and is symbolic of the dangers of mounting highly visible live events when viewer expectations steadily rise.
This legal dispute could try Netflix for various technical problems and issue a challenge to how the company plans to handle mass streaming events as it faces increasing competition in live sports rights. As of yet, the company has not said anything about this lawsuit.

20241121,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX, Financial) has broadcasted a record number of viewers. The live-stream matchboxing fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson has hit 108 million views and is the most streamed event on Netflix's sports platform. Scheduled for November 15 at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, the fight reached its highest number of concurrent viewers, or 65 million, 38 million of which were from the US.
Its Global AMA of 108 million, rating the event as one that records bests the figures of other main sporting broadcasts. The fight was Netflix's most-watched title of the week up through Sunday, with 46.6 million viewers. These numbers are derived from the TVision for US viewers and internal data for distinct viewers internationally.
Also, the co-main event with Amanda Serrano vs. Katie Taylor attracted 74 million live viewers from all over the world. The fight also attracted the highest AMA for a women's professional sports event in USA history, at 47 million.
No company is as dependent on third-party program suppliers as Netflix, but the service is seen in live sporting events as a way of reaching out to different customer bases, mainly in its scripted and documentary segments. This record-breaking viewership indicates that it is not only the initial days of the sports that can get a high television viewership. It also points towards the fact that the crossover boxing events are gaining popularity.
Appealing to entertainment with the help of such talents as Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, using the occasion of streaming, Netflix has identified itself as the major rival in the sphere of live sports streaming and broadcasting.

Pivotal Research raised the firm’s price target on Netflix (NFLX) to $1,100 from $925 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Post the “(mostly) successful” Mike Tyson and Logan Paul fight, which was streamed by a “massive” 65M households, Pivotal raised its medium and long term subscriber and average revenue per user forecasts for Netflix. When combined with a modest increase in its terminal EBITDA multiple, the firm increased the price target to a Street high $1,100. The boxing match is a successful learning experience for Netflix and the technical issues will not happen again with future live events, the analyst tells investors in a research note.

20241121,NFLX,"Investors with an interest in Broadcast Radio and Television stocks have likely encountered both Fox Corporation (FOX) and Netflix (NFLX). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Fox Corporation and Netflix are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FOX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.
FOX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.71, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 44.06. We also note that FOX has a PEG ratio of 1.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.68.
Another notable valuation metric for FOX is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 16.39.
Based on these metrics and many more, FOX holds a Value grade of A, while NFLX has a Value grade of D.
FOX sticks out from NFLX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FOX is the better option right now.

20241121,NFLX,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX).
Netflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.91, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.91 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.1% and 4.9% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying Netflix, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Story Continues
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.
Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.
Is NFLX a Good Investment?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $19.78.
Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Netflix.

Shares in Australia and Japan advanced. An index of US-listed Chinese stocks fell 1% Thursday, running against the grain of trading in New York but partly reflecting selling in Hong Kong stocks in their most recent session.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both rose Thursday. Nvidia ended higher and even touched a fresh intraday record in a sign investors re-calibrated initial concerns over its revenue outlook. The company assured investors that its new product lineup will continue to fuel an artificial intelligence-driven growth run.
“The guidance seems to show lower growth, but this may be Nvidia being conservative,” said Alvin Nguyen, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. “Short term, there is no worry about AI demand. Nvidia is doing everything they should be doing.”
Bitcoin set a fresh high, climbing past $98,000 on bets President-elect Donald Trump’s support for crypto and a looser regulatory environment will usher in a boom for the industry. A Fox Business News report suggested Chris Giancarlo, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was being weighed as the first “crypto czar” under the incoming administration.
Australian and New Zealand bonds were little changed Friday after Treasury yields rose across the curve Thursday. The policy-sensitive two-year yield climbed three basis points to end the session at the highest level since July. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee however, said he sees interest rates moving “a fair bit lower,” expressing confidence inflation is easing toward the central bank’s objective.
Mixed US labor data added to the debate as jobless claims came in lower than expected while continuing claims, a gauge of the number of people receiving benefits, rose to a three-year high.
Upward pressure on yields supported an index of the dollar. The greenback climbed against most major currencies Thursday and was little changed Friday. The Japanese currency edged higher early Friday as inflation in Japan held above the central bank’s target as expected.

Elsewhere in Asia, investors will be monitoring the fallout from a US indictment against Gautam Adani over allegations of bribery. Shares of Adani Group units tumbled and the conglomerate scrapped a $600 million dollar bond sale. The company denied the allegations.
Singapore’s economic expansion fared better than initially expected in the third quarter, prompting the city-state to upgrade its growth forecast for this year as recovery gained momentum.
Geopolitical Storm
Geopolitical tensions continued to simmer as Russia said it had launched a new kind of ballistic missile into Ukraine, boosting oil and gold prices Thursday. West Texas Intermediate was steady after rising almost 2% in the prior session. Gold was little changed after climbing for a fourth day on Thursday.
“Geopolitics always has a potential of introducing volatility in the market and we have seen that with what is happening in Ukraine,” Themis Themistocleous, chief investment officer, EMEA at UBS Wealth Management told Bloomberg Television. “We have been advising clients to include oil into their portfolio, or derivatives of oil, to be able to hedge against potential volatility.”
Elsewhere, strategists at market research firm Fundstrat expect US stocks to climb into the Thanksgiving holiday week, followed by some weakening in December.
“The Nvidia earnings report leaves the likelihood of a Thanksgiving rally intact,” they wrote. “The AI trajectory has not changed all that much, but the market’s immediate reaction is less important than the fact that the uncertainty over Nvidia’s results is behind us.”
Meanwhile, some of the anxiety in Washington over Trump’s pick for the top post at the US Treasury may be easing. The race has narrowed down to three front-runners - hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, private equity executive Marc Rowan and former Federal Reserve board member Kevin Warsh, according to according to BMO’s Ian Lyngen.

20241121,NVDA,"Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster shared his views about NVIDIA (NVDA)'s earnings call yesterday. Here is a summary of his thoughts:
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s earnings report provides insight into the company’s growth trajectory, highlighting the aspects that matter and those that don’t. The company delivered $35 billion in revenue for the October quarter, meeting whisper numbers, and issued a January guidance of $37.5 billion, slightly below the whisper number of $38 billion. Gross margins dipped a bit too, but ultimately these numbers don't matter as much.
The AI star lies in a boom or bust industry. Before the generative AI excitement, the company’s business declined 21% year-over-year. However, Nvidia’s market cap has skyrocketed since, driven by the extraordinary demand for its Blackwell GPUs.
The true pressure point for Nvidia lies in the commentary about Blackwell, Nvidia’s generative AI architecture. Looking at the key commentary from Nvidia’s CFO, we find that demand for Blackwell will continue to exceed supply for several quarters. There have also been some supply difficulties, albeit quite small.  This narrative has evolved positively compared to the October earnings call, with supply constraints expected to ease slightly earlier—from “into 2025” to “mid-2025.”
Additionally, the earnings call mentions twice that the demand for Blackwell has grown even stronger over the past three months, setting up 2025 as a robust year. While this doesn’t provide complete visibility into 2026, it does base a strong foundation for continued momentum.
Driving Nvidia’s growth is the principle of scaling laws. Scaling is what's effectively needed to make AI models smarter. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, likened this to Moore’s Law, where CPU speeds doubled every few years even though it was expected otherwise. The industry’s continuous innovation and adherence to scaling principles are bound to propel Nvidia’s AI computing demand, reinforcing the long-term outlook.
Wall Street projects 20% year-over-year growth for calendar year 2026. Based on Nvidia’s trajectory, Deepwater anticipates this could accelerate to over 30% growth, stating that there is plenty of time for the business to appreciate.
Our research director shared his views on NVDA's earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241121,NVDA,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. assured investors that its new product lineup will continue to fuel an artificial intelligence-driven growth run, while also signaling that the rush to get chips out the door is proving costlier than expected.

Speaking after the release of quarterly results, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said that Nvidia’s highly anticipated Blackwell products will ship this quarter amid “very strong” demand. But the production and engineering costs of the chips will weigh on profit margins, and Nvidia’s sales forecast for the current period didn’t match some of Wall Street’s more optimistic projections.
That brought a tepid reaction from investors, who had bid up Nvidia shares almost 200% this year heading into the earnings report. After that dizzying rally, which turned the chipmaker into the world’s most valuable company, anything but a blowout quarter was bound to be a disappointment.
The shares fell as much as 3.6% on Thursday before rebounding by the afternoon. They closed up 0.5% at $146.67.
Nvidia predicted fiscal fourth-quarter sales of about $37.5 billion. While the average analyst estimate was $37.1 billion, projections ranged as high as $41 billion.
“The guidance seems to show lower growth, but this may be Nvidia being conservative,” said Alvin Nguyen, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. “Short term, there is no worry about AI demand. Nvidia is doing everything they should be doing.”
The company’s biggest moneymaker is its accelerator chip, which helps develop artificial intelligence models by bombarding them with data. Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot debuted in 2022, a frenzy of AI services has created insatiable demand for the product.
All About Nvidia Chips, AI Hype and What Lies Ahead: QuickTake
Wall Street has been closely watching the launch of Blackwell, the latest entry in that category, which is faster and has an improved ability to link up with other semiconductors. Manufacturing challenges have slowed the rollout, and Nvidia warned again of supply constraints on Wednesday. Demand for the products is expected to exceed supply for several quarters.
“Critical questions around Blackwell’s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,” Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. “There’s little room for execution missteps in 2025.”

Huang said that Blackwell is now in “full production,” and there’s still an appetite for Hopper, the previous design. “Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners,” he said during the conference call.
But the switch to Blackwell has taken a toll on profitability. The company’s gross margin, which measures the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, will dip to as low as 73% this quarter from 75% in the previous period. The figure is expected to rebound when the new products reach larger-scale production, and the economics are more favorable.
When asked whether Nvidia’s gross margin could be back in the mid-70s by the middle of next year, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that’s a reasonable assumption. Nvidia remains far above its peers in this category: Its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has a gross margin that’s 20 percentage points narrower. Intel Corp.’s isn’t even half of Nvidia’s total.
Nvidia’s growth over the past two years has been staggering. Its sales are poised to double for a second year in a row, and it now notches more money in profit than it used to generate in total revenue.
Nvidia’s revenue rose 94% to $35.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 27. Excluding certain items, profit was 81 cents a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $33.25 billion and earnings of 74 cents a share.
Nvidia’s biggest division, the data center unit, saw revenue double from a year earlier to $30.8 billion. That beat Wall Street estimates.
But networking revenue within that unit declined sequentially, and the business is more dependent than ever on a small group of customers: cloud service providers. That cohort, which includes companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS, accounted for 50% of data center revenue, up from 45% in the prior period.
Investors want that number to go down, to show that the use of AI is spreading across the economy.
Other recent earnings reports have given strong signals for AI. Nvidia customers, including Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc., have reaffirmed their commitment to spend heavily on AI infrastructure.
WATCH: Nvidia's Surprising AI Origin Story
Nvidia has only missed analysts’ estimates on quarterly revenue once in the past five years. And it has exceeded expectations by as much as 20% in recent periods, creating a high bar for its performance.
Its data center division alone now has more revenue than rivals Intel and AMD have in total, combined. Net income this year is on course to exceed revenue at Intel, a business that was the chip industry’s biggest company for decades.
Nvidia made its name by selling graphics processors, but discovered that the technology also has applications for AI. Its chips help software models during the training process, when they learn to recognize and respond to real-world inputs. Nvidia’s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as ChatGPT.
The Santa Clara, California-based company has rapidly expanded its product lineup to include networking, software and services, as well as fully built-out computer systems. Huang is traveling the world lobbying for a broader adoption of his technology and trying to spread its use by corporations and government agencies.
“The age of AI is upon us and it’s large and diverse,” Huang said.

The S&P 500 advanced 0.5% after a choppy morning session spurred by swings in Nvidia Corp. and angst about the war in Ukraine. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.4% after dropping more than 1% earlier in the day. The fierce rally in Nvidia hit a speed bump following outlook that missed Wall Street’s high expectations. The stock resumed its climb in the final hours of trading to end the day in the green but shy of its latest all-time high.

Bitcoin extended its post-election run and is rapidly approaching $100,000 on bets President-elect Donald Trump’s support for crypto and looser regulation will usher in a boom for the industry. The planned departure of Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is expected to give a boost to deregulation and digital assets. A report suggested Chris Giancarlo, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was being weighed as the first “crypto czar” under the incoming administration.
Trump’s pick to overhaul the Justice Department, Matt Gaetz, withdrew himself from consideration of the post amid sexual misconduct allegations. Uncertainty over who Trump will name to the top spot at the Treasury remains up in the air and weighed on US bonds.
“The contest for the Treasury Secretary appears to have come down to Bessent, Rowan, and Warsh – all of whom fall into the category of qualified adults in the room,” according to BMO’s Ian Lyngen. Though, “clarity is always preferable from the market’s perspective.”
Yields on the 10-year Treasury steadied at 4.42% and the dollar rebounded after mixed labor data. Jobless claims came in lower than expected while continuing claims, a gauge of the number of people receiving benefits, rose to a three-year high.

“The Nvidia earnings report leaves the likelihood of a Thanksgiving rally intact,” they wrote. “The AI trajectory has not changed all that much, but the market’s immediate reaction is less important than the fact that the uncertainty over Nvidia’s results is behind us.”
To Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, this week’s conflicting reports from Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. suggest some restraint from American consumers, who should be watched closely.
“The state of the labor market and consumer spending are indicative of a soft landing and that’s a good thing,” the former Merrill Lynch trader said. “But they are also vulnerable to deterioration from here and if that occurs, then a hard landing becomes substantially more likely and that would be a decided negative for stocks.”
Housing is another worry as mortgage rates in the US started climbing again with the average for a 30-year fixed loan 6.84%, up from 6.78% last week.
Geopolitical Storm
Escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war gave oil and gold prices a boost, pushing WTI crude futures to around $70 a barrel. Ukraine reported that Russia fired an intercontinental ballistic missile during an overnight attack, while a Kremlin spokesman called Kyiv’s earlier use of UK Storm Shadow missiles a new escalation.
“Geopolitics always has a potential of introducing volatility in the market and we have seen that with what is happening in Ukraine,” Themis Themistocleous, chief investment officer, EMEA at UBS Wealth Management told Bloomberg Television. “We have been advising clients to include oil into their portfolio, or derivatives of oil, to be able to hedge against potential volatility.”

Artificial intelligence businesses have taken Wall Street by storm in the past few months. One of the most notable success stories has been OpenAI, the AI startup that has become the most valuable private firm in the world with a valuation of over $157 billion. However, the company is facing multiple lawsuits regarding the use of data from news publications without attribution. After US-based The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune took the company to court, Indian news publication ANI has also alleged that the ChatGPT creator is using published content without permission to help train the AI chatbot to provide information to users.

20241121,MSFT,"Nvidia (NVDA) is assuaging Wall Street’s concerns about any potential slowdowns in the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip, telling investors during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday that it’s on pace to exceed its previous revenue estimates for the current quarter.
“Blackwell production is in full steam,” CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.”
Prior to the earnings call, The Information reported on Nov. 17 that Nvidia was contending with overheating issues related to its Blackwell-based servers leading suppliers to adjust the design of the racks that house the servers. Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected.
The report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time.
Now Nvidia is saying that the chips aren’t just shipping, they’re in the hands of all of the company’s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker’s data center revenue. Ensuring they’re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia’s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that.

“With any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,” Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance.
“And I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.”
But there’s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth’s chips makes it difficult to meet demand.
“It is the case that demand exceeds supply,” Huang told analysts. “And that’s expected as we’re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.”

For some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.
The H100 is Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.
Story Continues
As Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need.
“Nvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,” New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. “And so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.”
In its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street’s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday.
This isn’t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company’s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.

AI stocks are soaring and AI startups are receiving billions in funding from venture capital firms as the new technology sweeps investors off their feet. However, as the AI boom plays out, the central bank in Europe has issued a dire warning about the development of an AI bubble. The warning was included in the biannual Financial Stability Review, a report that lists the risks that could threaten the financial well being of world markets. In the review, the European Central Bank noted that the stock market, particularly in the United States, had become increasingly dependent on a handful of companies perceived as the beneficiaries of the AI boom.

Per the ECB, this concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble. It added that in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointing. The ECB further underlined that investors were demanding a low premium to own shares and bonds while funds had cut their cash buffers. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments, the ECB said.

20241121,MSFT,"Wherever C3.ai CEO Tom Siebel goes he fields the same question about the future of AI.
“Everybody's asking me about it, ‘Is there a bubble here?’ Absolutely there's a bubble. It's huge,” he tells Fortune in an exclusive interview at C3.ai’s New York offices in a Midtown WeWork.
Over the last two years, analysts have pondered whether AI companies, both public and private, could possibly live up to their lofty valuations. Tom Siebel, who built his career in Silicon Valley as a sales executive at Oracle before leaving to start his own company that he eventually sold back to his former employer for $5.8 billion, the current state of AI reminded him of the dot-com bubble. Even then a great and wondrous technology—the internet—couldn’t save a host of companies from coming crashing down.
“So we have this similar thing going on with generative AI that we've seen with previous technologies,” Siebel said. “The market is way, way overvaluing.”
Tech analysts that Fortune spoke to broadly agreed with Siebel’s point that valuations across the industry were inflated. “For now, virtually every notable AI company enjoys a fair degree of investor hype,” said Sandeep Rao, senior researcher at Leverage Shares, a provider of ETPs.
C3.ai specializes in enterprise AI applications that help companies with various business functions like optimizing their supply chain, predictive maintenance, and tracking their sales process. It also has a spate of lucrative government contracts with the likes of the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force. Among its biggest private sector customers are oil and gas giant Shell and energy company Baker Hughes (whose contract is up for renewal soon).
Earlier this week C3.ai added another blue chip partner to its ranks when it announced a partnership with Microsoft. Fortune’s interview with Siebel was conducted before the partnership was publicly revealed. (Alan Murray the former CEO of Fortune Media is on the board of C3.ai).
In particular, Siebel took aim at OpenAI, the startup with close ties to Microsoft and that is perhaps most closely associated with the AI revolution. OpenAI currently has a $157 billion valuation after an October funding round in which it raised $6 billion. Siebel wasn’t impressed by that valuation.
“Nobody would be surprised if that company disappeared next Monday,” he said.
When Fortune ventured that industry observers would be surprised, Siebel responded that it had “disappeared” over Thanksgiving, a reference to the brief ouster of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in 2023.
Story Continues
“If it disappeared, it wouldn't make any difference in the world,” Siebel said of OpenAI. “Nothing would change. I mean, nobody's life would change. No company would change. Microsoft would find something else to power Copilot. There's like 10 other products available that would do it equally as good.”
The OpenAI brand name has cachet because it was first to market, but that alone can’t guarantee its market position in perpetuity, said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETF, an exchange-traded fund based out of Greenwich, Conn. “Just because you're very well known doesn't mean that you can't be copied, replicated, and maybe even surpassed,” Marino said.
In Rao’s view, there are differences between large language models, but they are difficult to understand. “LLMs are highly proprietary and nailing down definitive distinctions isn’t easy,” he said.
Their success, he added, is often due just as much to their business relationships as it is to their underlying tech. “An LLM’s advantage isn’t necessarily dictated by quality but could be dictated by low cost barriers and ease of use with existing tech instead,” Rao said.
In this regard, OpenAI certainly fits the bill, having established deep ties with Microsoft.
OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment regarding Siebel’s comments.
Siebel sees overvaluations throughout early stage AI startups as well.
“There’s a long list of AI startups out of Illinois, Wisconsin, Stanford, that are being financed today on Sand Hill Road, where very little ideas by people who are highly inexperienced, who are going to build generative AI applications for dentist office, veterinarians, or divorce lawyers and these ideas are being financed at multi-billion dollar valuations,” Siebel said. They’re “just five people who don't know anything [with] four pages of a business plan. This is crazy.”
Over the last few years, a spate of AI startups with highly specific use cases has cropped up, some of which have indeed sold or raised money at large valuations. Their track records have been a mixed bag. In August 2023, Casetext, which specializes in AI for legal work, sold to Thomson Reuters for $650 million. JasperAI, a startup focused on AI for marketing departments, raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in a Series A in June 2023 only to cut its internal valuation three months later, according to The Information.
Exempt from Siebel’s criticism are the major tech giants developing their own suite of AI products. Microsoft and Amazon, he said, are “great companies” that aren’t overvalued. Neither are chipmakers Nvidia and TSMC. “If TSMC went out of business it would be the end of the world,” he said.
When asked where C3.ai belongs, Siebel naturally has no doubts. “C3.ai is a bargain, okay? I mean, it's a value stock buddy,” he said.

""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after Microsoft reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue growth in its Azure cloud segment. Additionally, management’s fiscal first[1]quarter 2025 Azure revenue guidance came in slightly below estimates. Despite this shortfall, management highlighted that AI contributed 7% to cloud growth, up from 6% last quarter and 3% a year ago. We continue to believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain a leadership role in AI, given its innovative approach and significant growth potential.""

20241121,MSFT,"We recently published a list of Ken Griffin Stock Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other Ken Griffin's portfolio stocks to buy.
One of Wall Street’s Greatest
Ken Griffin, the visionary founder of Citadel Investment Group, launched his hedge fund in 1990 with $4.2 million, achieving unprecedented success. In 2022, Griffin’s fund delivered an extraordinary 153% return, driven by accurate bets on inflation and interest rates. With a portfolio now exceeding $518 billion, Citadel Investment Group is one of Wall Street’s most closely watched hedge funds, consistently achieving over 25% annual returns since 2016. Citadel employs a multi-strategy investment approach, combining long and short positions to capitalize on market opportunities. Its flagship fund, Wellington, anchors Citadel’s operations by investing across multiple asset classes and sectors, emphasizing diversification. In 2022, Wellington achieved an impressive 38% return, building on 26% in 2021 and 24% in 2020. Notably, the fund posted a 19.4% gain in 2019, more than double its 9.1% return in 2018.
While Griffin’s legacy is strongly tied to Citadel’s hedge fund, a significant portion of his Forbes-calculated net worth comes from Citadel Securities, valued at $22 billion after Sequoia and Paradigm acquired a small stake two years ago. Citadel Securities has redefined modern trading, challenging the traditional dominance of big banks. In just two decades, it has become the largest stock buyer and seller in the U.S.; in August, it facilitated more equity trading within its electronic network than the New York Stock Exchange’s main market. In 2023, Citadel Securities generated $2.8 billion in profit from $6.3 billion in net revenue, with an impressive $4.9 billion in net revenue achieved in the first half of 2024 alone.

The billionaire also ranks among the top donors to outside spending groups for the 2024 election, which secured former President Donald Trump a second term. As the founder and CEO of Citadel, he contributed $100 million to conservative causes, making him the fifth-largest individual contributor to federal election spending, according to Federal Election Commission data. While Griffin has donated millions to Republican candidates, particularly since 2022, he has notably refrained from directly supporting Trump’s campaign. A self-described “Reagan Republican,” Griffin has historically favored establishment-focused Super PACs, such as the Congressional Leadership Fund.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT): A Cloud Powerhouse in Ken Griffin's Portfolio
A development team working together to create the next version of Windows.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Citadel Investment Group’s Stake: $544.1 million
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a global tech leader, specializes in productivity software, cloud solutions, and personal computing products. Its products are distributed through OEMs, distributors, resellers, and directly via digital marketplaces, online platforms, and retail stores.
In FY25 Q1, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) posted $65.6 billion in revenue, a 16% year-over-year increase. The strong start to the fiscal year was fueled by Microsoft Cloud, which generated $38.9 billion in revenue. Segment-wise, Productivity and Business Processes revenue grew 12%, Intelligent Cloud rose 20%, and More Personal Computing increased by 17%, year-over-year.
On October 31, Citi reaffirmed its Buy rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a price target of $497, despite a mixed quarterly performance. The company exceeded top and bottom-line expectations, driven by a 1-2% revenue boost from Azure cloud services and a 5% rise in EPS, supported by 23% year-over-year growth in commercial bookings. However, the results were influenced by one-off factors like favorable revenue recognition and foreign exchange rates. Additionally, Microsoft’s Q2 guidance fell short of analyst expectations due to new capacity constraints with a collocation partner, which is projected to slow Azure’s growth by 1-2 percentage points.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $147 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. Shares gave back some gains from strong performance over the first half of this year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported a strong quarter with total revenue growing 16%, in line with the Street; Microsoft Cloud up 22%; Azure up 30%; 43% operating income margins; and 36% free cash flow margins. Core Azure growth came in one point shy of expectations, however, due to a soft European market and continued constraints on AI compute capacity. In the same vein, while Microsoft reiterated its fiscal 2025 targets of double-digit top-line and operating income growth, quarterly guidance called for Azure growth to slow a bit before accelerating in the back half of the fiscal year, as capital expenditures increase, yielding an expansion of AI compute capacity. We believe this investment is a leading indicator for growth, with more than half of the spend related to durable land and data center build outs, which should monetize over the next 15-plus years. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes, and we remain investors.”
Overall, MSFT ranks 8th on our list of Ken Griffin's portfolio stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241121,MSFT,"Dan Ives Expects 'Drop The Mic Performance' Tomorrow From Nvidia: Here's Why
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
Jensen Huang-led Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised to dominate as major tech players Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ramp up their capital expenditures on artificial intelligence.

Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.
What Happened: On Tuesday, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives took to X, formerly Twitter, and predicted a strong performance from Nvidia, calling it the “only game in town with $1 trillion of AI Cap-Ex on the way.”
“We believe $2 billion beat/$2 billion guide higher,” Ives concluded.


Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, which reported its third-quarter financial results last month, exceeded its capex spending forecasts, driven largely by AI investments. The company raised the lower end of its 2024 capex guidance by $1 billion to $38 billion, with a significant increase anticipated in 2025.
Google’s parent company is also set to match its capex spending in the fourth quarter, bringing its total 2024 capex to $51.4 billion, a 59% increase year-over-year. The company also anticipates a rise in apex in 2025, albeit at a slower rate.
Similarly, Microsoft reported a capex of $20 billion for the first quarter, nearly double the $11.2 billion from the same period last year. The company’s CFO Amy Hood expects a sequential increase in capital expenditure due to the projected demand for cloud and AI services.

Why It Matters: Analysts have predicted a “beat-n-raise” performance in Nvidia’s third-quarter earnings, with an expected revenue of $33.12 billion, a significant increase from last year’s $18.12 billion. The tech giant will report earnings on Wednesday, Nov. 20.
Despite recent overheating issues with Nvidia’s new Blackwell AI chips, the company’s value is expected to surge, driven by the potential of the next-generation AI chip. Earlier in September, Analyst Beth Kindig of I/O Fund projected a $10 trillion valuation for Nvidia.

20241121,MSFT,"Over the past several years, Big Tech firms like Google and Microsoft have trumpeted ambitious plans to go carbon-neutral, or even carbon-negative, by 2030. But then the generative-AI boom came along and threw a giant wrench in their plans.
AI models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini, which underpin this latest tech craze, suck up vast amounts of energy. In the race to develop better models, with the help of more data centers to train and operate them, companies will need a lot more power to come online, and soon.
One way Big Tech hopes to achieve this, while also keeping its commitment to carbon-free emissions, is by tapping a source that has been much maligned in the U.S.: nuclear power.
In recent months, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all signed deals to help boost the development of new reactors and restart decommissioned ones. Their agreements are a huge endorsement for the nuclear industry and a sign that the tide against it may be turning.
But getting these ambitious projects to the finish line is far from assured, if the industry’s track record is any guide. Of the 94 reactors currently active in the U.S., only four were built within the past three decades.
Public opposition over safety and questions about long-term storage of radioactive waste have made building new nuclear facilities almost a nonstarter. The industry is also facing competition from increasingly cheaper renewable energy that has made nuclear far less attractive financially.
But with the rise of artificial intelligence, and its huge demand for electricity, supporters of nuclear energy feel they have a new opening. And the tech industry has become their new best friend.
The rising impact of data centers on the electrical grid, in many cases to fuel artificial intelligence, is dramatic. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs predicted that server farms would suck up 8% of all U.S. electricity by 2030, up from just 3% in 2022. The data center boom is already a prime reason for soaring power costs across the country.
Big Tech’s rapid expansion into AI threatens to overwhelm grids and “blow apart” the sector’s climate promises, argues Tyson Slocum, energy program director at consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which opposes nuclear energy. “Their Hail Mary is nukes.”
Among the sector’s attractions are its nearly carbonless footprint and around-the-clock availability, in contrast to solar and wind, which generate electricity that fluctuates depending on the elements. And the argument for it isn’t entirely based on AI and data centers, but also on the rise of electric vehicle charging and the electrification of heating.
Story Continues
“The demand picture has changed so radically that the economics actually get helped out a lot,” says Bobby Hollis, Microsoft’s vice president of energy.
There is plenty of enthusiasm among lawmakers for this potential nuclear revival. Last December, 25 countries including the U.S. signed a declaration calling for the tripling of nuclear-energy generation by 2050.
Then this year, the U.S. passed the Advance Act, which promises to simplify the permitting process for new nuclear reactors. Traditional reactors have taken as long as a decade to approve, which adds to their already huge cost.
A big part of the nuclear revival hinges on what are known as small modular reactors, or SMRs, a largely unproven technology. They involve mini reactors that are made in factories and assembled on-site, which would theoretically speed up the notoriously lengthy process of building nuclear plants.
“Mini,” however, is a relative term. The reactors can still be as big as an office building.
So far, there are no functioning SMRs in the U.S. The only examples are a few that recently went live in Russia and China.
In October, Google kicked off tech’s dealmaking for SMR-produced energy by signing an agreement with Kairos Power, which promises to deliver six or seven reactors between 2030 and 2035.
Just two days later, Amazon gave X-energy, another startup hoping to introduce SMRs, a high-profile lift by anchoring a $500 million investment round in the company. The e-commerce giant has also plowed money into public power agency Energy Northwest’s nuclear project in Washington, due in 2031, which would be powered by SMRs built by X-energy.
But many are unconvinced that SMRs are the answer. “We still have to see how much they cost and how well the designs being marketed actually work,” says David Schlissel, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think tank that is skeptical about nuclear power.
Greg Cullen, a vice president at Amazon SMR partner Energy Northwest, acknowledged the possibility that early projects may be more expensive on a dollar-per-kilowatt basis than large reactors are. However, he said lessons from these initial deployments could lead to lower costs in future SMR projects.
Meanwhile, in September, Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation Energy to revive Unit 1 at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island plant, the site, in 1979, of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The reactor in question wasn’t the one involved in the partial meltdown, but rather one that had been shuttered in 2019 because it was too expensive to operate.
Constellation says the reactor, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, will return to service a few years from now. Microsoft won’t directly draw on Crane’s output, but will instead use it to “match” its energy needs elsewhere and therefore avoid additional fossil-fuel plants having to be built, says Hollis.
Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, Amazon is also trying to tap into an existing nuclear plant, the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, by using the energy the facility produces to power an adjacent data center. However, the company’s plans to expand the data center hit a major snag in November. Regulators sided with complaints from utilities, which buy electricity from the plant’s owner, that the Amazon deal would increase prices for regular power users and threaten the grid’s reliability.
Amazon insists that—even after claiming as much as 960 megawatts of power from Susquehanna, as it would like to—there would be enough left over to satisfy local demand. While the deal doesn’t introduce new power to the grid, Amazon says it should provide enough stable revenue to the plant’s operator to keep the facility active for the foreseeable future.
Financially, most of the tech companies are taking on little risk with their nuclear alliances. The so-called power purchase agreements they’ve signed give some financial security to the power-generation projects without placing any risk on themselves if the projects fail to pan out.
Public Citizen’s Slocum says the reluctance of tech companies to provide upfront funding for nuclear development suggests “there is still hesitation about risk uncertainty with the nuclear build-out.”
Amazon is the exception by leading the big investment in X-energy, which Amazon data center chief Kevin Miller says is the right way to “help companies develop their climate solutions faster.”
In the case of the former Three Mile Island, Constellation has reportedly applied for a federal loan guarantee that would cover the $1.6 billion cost of restarting the reactor. Some have argued that this shifts much of the risk onto taxpayers, though Constellation says it just enables lower-interest-rate financing, and insists the company would repay such a loan itself.
There are also concerns about the length of time it will take for any new nuclear power to come online. The demand for more energy is immediate, but none of the production related to the recent deals with Big Tech will be completed for at least a few years. The focus instead, nuclear critics say, should be on renewables like wind and solar, which are widely proven to work. Also, renewables could soon provide reliable 24/7 power, thanks to advances in energy storage like batteries and gradual improvements in connecting clean power projects to the broader electrical grid.
Microsoft’s Hollis reckons renewables could plausibly satisfy Big Tech’s energy cravings, once the connection and storage pieces of the puzzle are in place. But certainly for the next couple of decades, says Hollis, “nuclear will have a role to play.”

With Donald Trump having won the elections, it seems Elon Musk is going to be a powerful force in the administration.  After all, X CEO has played an outsized role in his comeback, contributing millions to his campaign, serving as policy advisor, and even using his social media platform as a Make America Great Again (MAGA) advocacy platform.
Now that his efforts have come to fruition Max Tegmark, a leading scientist, who has previously worked with the world’s richest person says Musk’s influence could lead to tougher safety standards for artificial intelligence, as reported by The Guardian.

Tegmark says Musk’s backing of a failed AI bill demonstrated that Musk is still worried about the repercussions of uncontrolled AI development. The SB 1047 bill in California required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them.
Having frequently warned that such an unrestrained development can be catastrophic for humanity, Musk was one of the 30,000 others who had signed a letter calling for a pause on the development of advanced AI technology last year.
According to Tegmark, Musk could convince Trump to introduce standards that prevent the growth of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a term used for AI systems that match or surpass human levels of intelligence.
“I do think that if Elon manages to get Trump’s ear on AI issues we’re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI. He might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.”
Before Trump won the elections, Musk had predicted the development of artificial intelligence that would be smarter than the smartest human being by next year or by 2026.
""If you define AGI (artificial general intelligence) as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably next year, within two years”.

20241121,CRWD,"CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity leader, with a growth strategy centered on becoming the one-stop solution for all enterprise cybersecurity needs through platform expansion. Fundamentally, the company has a high-quality and stable earnings profile, driven by its strong recurring revenue base from the continued adoption of new product modules. At CrowdStrike's FY24 Investor Day, management announced its goal of reaching $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, which is supported by a strong free cash flow margin. However, this goal was affected by the global outage on July 19, which was due to the company releasing a flawed sensor configuration update for its Falcon platform, resulting in around 8.5 million Windows devices crashing. This caused significant reputational damage to the cybersecurity leader, as the outage led to grounded flights, canceled medical procedures and widespread disruption. Following this incident, the stock took a sharp dive, dropping from $345 to $264 on July 22, as investors reacted to the news.

CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
CRWD Data by GuruFocus
The repercussions from the July 19 outage was revealed when the company reported its Q2 FY25 earnings. Despite the outage, the company managed to outperform wall-street analysts' revenue and earnings expectations, leading to a 3% stock price increase following the earnings release. However, with its Q2 FY25 earnings results, management released its lowered top-line and bottom-line guidance for the upcoming quarters. Despite this lowered guidance, the stock largely rebounded, and is now in line with the S&P 500's YTD returns. My long-term investment perspective for CrowdStrike lies on one key trend in cybersecurity: the growing demand from enterprise customers to consolidate multiple-vendor solutions onto a single platform to cut costs. Consequently, the recent macroeconomic pressures have forced enterprise customers to focus on efficiency and find ways to do more with less. Thus, this key trend remains strong and I believe CrowdStrike is well-positioned to benefit, as it provides one of the top platforms in the market at significant cost-savings.
The Falcon Platform: One-Stop Shop
CrowdStrike is basically known as an endpoint protection company in the cybersecurity market, but I don't think this fully captures the scope of services that the company currently offers. In reality, it operates as a one-stop platform for enterprise cybersecurity solutions, which was a key point highlighted during its Q2 FY25 earnings presentation. While there are many competitors in the industry, no other competitor is able to offer the scope of services that CrowdStrike does. Thus, as mentioned previously, I believe that CrowdStrike is positioned well to benefit in a time where enterprises are increasingly looking to consolidate its cybersecurity infrastructure. As a result, CrowdStrike's platform is able to serve as a consolidated solution, which is difficult to compete with in the current cybersecurity landscape.

[CrowdStrike IR]
George Kurtz (CEO of CrowdStrike) pointed out that enterprise customers are focused on efficiency and reducing complexity, noting that Customers don't want to go backwards and have a patchwork of products. They are still focused on the consolidation piece and they're looking at us as one of the key consolidators in the market"". What was actually meant by this statement is evident in the fact that about 65% of the company's customers use five or more modules, 45% use six or more and 30% use seven or modules. Furthermore, among larger customers that spend over $100,000 annually on CrowdStrike's services, nearly half use eight or more modules. This highlights the depth of the consolidation in CrowdStrike's cybersecurity customer portfolio, making it significantly challenging to compete with.
Further, I found a research piece from Gartner that noted that 75% of enterprise customers are actively looking to decrease the number of cybersecurity vendors that they work with, further supporting the industry trend of vendor consolidation. Thus, the primary goal for enterprise customers is to increase integration and lower vendor management costs, and this shift will likely result in a handful of dominant players emerging in the market. Given CrowdStrike's early focus on consolidation through its Falcon platform, it is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
Post-Outage Recovery
Post the outage on July 19, CrowdStrike experienced some disruption in its sales pipeline with a few deals placed on hold, and to be finalized in subsequent quarters. Consequently, management clarified to investors that the larger part of those delayed deals would still stay in the pipeline. That said, investors should be prepared to hear that some of the new customers are going to be more cautious than usual, since the company has lost some trust within the marketplace as a result of the outage. During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, CFO Burt Podbere noted the following: ""We expect to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, with additional scrutiny requiring higher levels of approval at the CEO and, in some cases, Board of Directors level."" The meaning behind this is simple: the longer the list of approvals, the more protracted the sales cycle will be, especially in large corporations. Although the CFO didn't mention the exact delay periods, I expect bigger deals to take close to six months to finalize.
To address the situation, it appears that CrowdStrike has introduced customer commitment packages, wherein the company gives a discount and other incentives to their customers in return for signing longer-term contracts. This may, however, affect the company's revenues for the next few quarters, but it's important to note that CrowdStrike still managed to win several eight and nine-figure deals despite the outage. For example, within cloud security, CrowdStrike secured an eight-figure deal with a major enterprise software firm, which opted to standardize on Falcon Cloud Security across its entire business, replacing another next-gen cloud security vendor. Similarly, a nine-figure cloud security deal saw a large enterprise adopt Falcon Cloud Security across a million hosts, replacing other cloud security products.
In the Security information and event management (SIEM) market, CrowdStrike continues to outperform legacy SIEM providers. Two major deals stand out: an eight-figure deal with an existing customer, which replaced two legacy SIEMs with CrowdStrike's LogScale, resulting in over 60% cost savings, and a seven-figure deal with a leading generative AI company, which standardized on LogScale after a year of use, improving search speed, response times, and total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to their previous legacy SIEM solution.
Expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)
CrowdStrike's growth story is further supported by the expanding TAM. In 2024, the TAM for cybersecurity is expected to be around $100 billion, but this figure is projected to grow to $225 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8%. Even if CrowdStrike only manages to grow in line with the market, the company has a long runway for growth. Given its platformization strategy, I believe CrowdStrike is positioned to outpace market growth and capture significant market share.
Strong Results Despite Challenges
CrowdStrike's Q2 FY25 results, in my view, basically showcase the company's resilience and strength, even in the face of significant adversity (with the recent outage and macro pressures). The company reported revenue of $964 million (up 31.7% YoY), overperforming wall-street guidance by $5.5 million. With 94% of its revenue coming from subscriptions, the growth in this segment is a key indicator of CrowdStrike's performance. Subscription revenue grew 33% YoY, while ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) was up 32%, reaching $3.9 billion. This included $218 million in net new ARR, an 11% increase YoY, in line with the company's guidance.

[CrowdStrike IR]
CrowdStrike also reported record non-GAAP operating income of $227 million, representing a 46% YoY increase, signaling excellent operational efficiency. Notably, non-GAAP operating income is growing faster than revenue, demonstrating the company's operating leverage, a key strength in the tech sector, where many companies prioritize growth over profitability.
Robust Cash Flow Generation
Free cash flows increased by 44% YoY to $272 million in Q2 FY25, with a 28% free cash flow margin, highlighting the company's ability to fund its own growth. The company achieved what it calls the ""rule of 60"" during the quarter. This means that the sum of its YoY revenue growth rate (approximately 32%) and its free cash flow margin (28%) equals 60. The term is derived from the ""rule of 40,"" a concept introduced by Brad Feld, who describes it as the idea that a company's growth rate combined with its profitability should total at least 40%. For example, a 20% growth rate should correspond with a 20% profit margin, while a 50% growth rate could be paired with a 10% loss. Exceeding this benchmark is rare, which is why investors tend to value CrowdStrike more highly compared to other growth stocks.
Lowered Management Guidance
Although the company reported great Q2 FY25 results despite the outage, the repercussions of the outage is largely reflected in CrowdStrike's full-year guidance. Management lowered its initial revenue guidance for FY25 by 1.5%, now expecting revenue to be between $3.896 billion and $3.989 billion, down from the original forecast of $3.924 billion to $3.989 billion. Non-GAAP operating income guidance was also reduced by 11.23%, with the new midpoint at $788.5 million, down from $888.3 million. While Q3 FY25 is expected to show continued revenue growth of 34.2%, non-GAAP operating income growth is forecasted to slow to 8.3%, reflecting the near-term impact of the outage on profitability.
Capacity For Continued Investments
I have already mentioned Crowdstrike's ability to drive impressive revenue growth and operational efficiency. But, in addition to this, the reason that I'm bullish on the company is mainly due to the fact that CrowdStrike's fundamental strengths are also backed by its commitment to reinvest back into the core business. Looking at the closest rival to CrowdStrike (Palo Alto Networks), CrowdStrike's Capex to CFO ratio is relatively higher. Although Palo Alto Networks has larger R&D capex spending in absolute terms, if CRWD sustains its impressive CFO growth, it will likely close the gap with PANW soon. CrowdStrike's top-line and CFO is growing much faster compared to rivals.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
CRWD Data by GuruFocus
Strong Balance Sheet
CrowdStrike also maintains a solid balance sheet. As of Q2 FY25, the company held $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents against $743.2 million in long-term debt, giving it a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of 0.28. Furthermore, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.75 suggests that CrowdStrike can comfortably manage its debt using operating profits. Furthermore, while some competitors and investors overhyped the potential for CrowdStrike to lose business, the company's operating leverage remains on track. With its continued focus on platform consolidation, I expect CrowdStrike to maintain its leadership position and recover from the recent setbacks caused by the outage.
Valuation Thoughts
From a valuation standpoint, I am quite optimistic about CrowdStrike's potential. I believe CrowdStrike is currently trading at a significant discount, especially when considering the several growth catalysts that will unfold in both the short and long term. At the moment, CrowdStrike is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23x, which is well below its five-year historical average of 29x. This disparity may suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its historical valuation, presenting a unique buying opportunity for investors. In the near term, I anticipate that CrowdStrike's stock may experience some additional drawdowns as investors reassess their positions in light of the recent outage. However, I view this as a temporary phase, which could provide a compelling entry point for those who may have missed out on the stock during its earlier growth stages.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
CRWD Data by GuruFocus
Historically, CrowdStrike's P/S ratio has been considerably higher, so I expect that as the company fully recovers from the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) incident, its valuation will revert closer to the five-year average of 29x. Given these factors, I'm setting a target multiple of 27x, which would imply a price target of around $375 per share. This represents an upside of approximately 20%, which, in my opinion, provides a solid margin for investors to take advantage of at current levels.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
[Alpha Spread]
From a discounted cash flow (DCF) perspective, I used a discount rate of 8% (which reflects the company's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC) and applied a conservative terminal growth rate of 5%. This DCF analysis aligns with Wall Street's growth forecasts for CrowdStrike over the next five years, which reflects a topline-growth rate of 15% over the next five years and some operating leverage improvements as the company expands beyond endpoint protection and solidifies its position as a leader in platform consolidation, offering a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity services. The scalability and robustness of the Falcon platform have already been proven, supporting the optimistic outlook from analysts. Based on this DCF model, I derive an upside of roughly 19% (with a target price of $408), which I believe offers ample margin for value investors seeking to capitalize on CrowdStrike's current valuation. Given the company's strong fundamentals, its recovery potential, and the broader market opportunity, I see this as an attractive entry point for those looking to invest at these levels.
Conclusion
Despite the recent outage and its immediate challenges, I remain confident in CrowdStrike's long-term growth potential. The company's current market position, and the strategy towards platform consolidation positions it well to capitalize on the growing trend of enterprise customers seeking to streamline their cybersecurity solutions with a single provider to save costs and improve efficiency. Even after the setback (with regards to BSOD), CrowdStrike secured significant deals, demonstrating resilience and maintaining market trust. Additionally, with its current valuation appearing attractive compared to historical averages, a robust balance sheet, and a proven ability to drive growth through its Falcon platform, I see this as a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on its recovery and long-term market potential.

20241121,CRWD,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).
CrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 6.7% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.
ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank
In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.
Story Continues
The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.
Is CRWD a Good Investment?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.65.
Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike.

Market participants will be closely following the financial results of CrowdStrike Holdings in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on November 26, 2024. On that day, CrowdStrike Holdings is projected to report earnings of $0.82 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $982.26 million, up 24.97% from the prior-year quarter.
Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion, indicating changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, compared to the previous year.
Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for CrowdStrike Holdings. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Our research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

Investors should also note CrowdStrike Holdings's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 92.37. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 30.95 of its industry.
We can also see that CRWD currently has a PEG ratio of 3.28. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate.

That's why a stock split, which multiplies the number of shares an investor owns or that an investor can buy, always makes big news. Hot tech stocks are prone to splitting when their share price gets excessively high and there is speculation these three tech stocks could be primed for a split.

CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD)
If you've ever surfed the web, you have likely used a website that uses CrowdStrike to keep the site secure. Since its IPO in 2019, CrowdStrike has established itself as one of the world's most recognizable cloud-based cybersecurity companies. Back then, its shares traded for only $34, but today, a share in CrowdStrike will set you back a hefty $336.
CrowdStrike occupies a large market share, largely because it's one of the few cybersecurity companies that provide its services via cloud apps instead of directly installing applications like DVDs. This approach allows Crowdstrike's biggest clients, many of which are tech companies or have extensive Web-based operations, to keep the same service as their operations expand.
Crowdstrike's reputation hit in the summer when it experienced a global outage that knocked some of the world's biggest tech companies offline. Despite that, the company's public filings show that CrowdStrike became profitable in 2024. More importantly, analysts expect this stock's earnings per share (EPS) to grow by over 70% by 2027. If CrowdStrike hits those targets, this stock price may shoot so high that a split becomes a strong possibility.

Although the company has yet to turn a profit, analysts at Barclays and Citigroup have recently upgraded their price targets for MongoDB to $345 and $400.

ASML's Q3 2024 report showed a nearly 60% increase over Q3 2023 and company management predicted revenue would exceed $63 billion by 2030. This company has been around since 1995 and its stock has split four times. The last one came in 2007, but ASML's share price has jumped by nearly 1,500% to the current price of $658.63. Another bonus for ASML shareholders is that it pays a dividend of 0.098% ($6.45/share).
Considering this stock's previous history of splitting and its current sky-high share price, it's not hard to imagine ASML getting set for another split at some point in the future. In the meantime, analysts at JP Morgan and Wells Fargo have given ASML a ""buy now"" rating. The buy-in isn't cheap, but the prospect of earning a dividend and a future stock split makes ASML worth some attention from tech investors.

20241121,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 26% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Check out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings
How To Calculate Return On Equity?
The formula for ROE is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for CrowdStrike Holdings is:
6.0% = US$175m ÷ US$2.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.
What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
CrowdStrike Holdings' Earnings Growth And 6.0% ROE
On the face of it, CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that CrowdStrike Holdings grew its net income at a significant rate of 28% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
We then compared CrowdStrike Holdings' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period.

20241121,CRWD,"Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.
What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for CrowdStrike Holdings, this is the formula:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.012 = US$53m ÷ (US$7.2b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).
Thus, CrowdStrike Holdings has an ROCE of 1.2%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 9.0%.
See our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings
NasdaqGS:CRWD Return on Capital Employed November 14th 2024
In the above chart we have measured CrowdStrike Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CrowdStrike Holdings for free.
What Can We Tell From CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE Trend?
The fact that CrowdStrike Holdings is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 1.2% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 439% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.
Our Take On CrowdStrike Holdings' ROCE
In summary, it's great to see that CrowdStrike Holdings has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CrowdStrike Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.

20241121,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD has staged an impressive comeback, with shares rallying 34% over the past three months. This surge follows the significant dip in its share price triggered by the global IT outage on July 19, 2024.
CRWD stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry and the S&P 500 index’s rise of 16.2% and 10%, respectively, in the past three months. It has also fared better than other cybersecurity players, including Palo Alto Networks PANW, CyberArk Software CYBR and Check Point Software CHKP.

This outperformance has made investors wonder if this is the right time to buy or hold CRWD stock and wait for more stability. Here’s why maintaining a hold strategy could be the most prudent move.
Resilience in CRWD’s Financial Performance Post Outage
CrowdStrike’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results underscore the company’s capacity to rebound and sustain investor confidence. Despite the disruption from the July incident, CRWD reported a strong $963.9 million in revenues, representing 31.7% year-over-year growth and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $5.3 million.
The company also recorded non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up 40.5% from the year-ago quarter and beating the consensus mark by 6 cents. These figures highlight the firm’s resilient business model and operational strength, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.
This robust performance, achieved despite deal delays in the final weeks of the second quarter, reflects the loyalty of CrowdStrike’s customer base and the trust built over the years. The company’s annual recurring revenues (ARR) reached $3.86 billion, up 32% year over year, showcasing consistent demand for its cybersecurity solutions.
CrowdStrike’s Strategic Enhancements and Innovation
CrowdStrike has not rested on its laurels. The company's proactive measures following the July 19 outage included the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.
The Falcon platform’s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike’s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.
Story Continues
CrowdStrike’s Market Position and Customer Loyalty
CrowdStrike’s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm’s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.
Moreover, the company's “Falcon Flex” subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.
Navigating Near-Term Challenges for CrowdStrike
Despite these positives, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company’s guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management’s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.
Analysts have also turned slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings depicts a downward estimate revision.

Potential legal exposures related to the July 19 incident and the competitive pressures from other cybersecurity players could introduce risks. However, CrowdStrike’s solid financial foundation, evidenced by $4.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents, offers a buffer for navigating such uncertainties.
CrowdStrike’s Lofty Valuation Raises Concern
CrowdStrike’s current valuation raises concerns. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. CRWD stock is currently trading at 82.85X forward 12-month earnings compared with 34.95X for the industry. Similarly, it trades at 18.39X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry’s 2.83X. These elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.

Conclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now
While CrowdStrike’s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.
CrowdStrike’s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241121,CRWD,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Performing Cybersecurity Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other best performing cybersecurity stocks in 2024.
Data Breaches to Disruptions
The technology sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, creating an increasingly interconnected digital world. Cybersecurity, a relatively new field, has become critical as the volume of sensitive data stored online has surged. This growth has unfortunately provided more opportunities for cybercriminals to commit financial theft, steal confidential information, and disrupt vital infrastructure. In 2023 alone, data breaches affected over 349 million individuals, highlighting a troubling trend. The Consumer Sentinel Network received a surge in reports, with fraud making up over 2.6 million cases and identity theft surpassing one million. The scale of these threats is substantial; according to McKinsey, damages from cyberattacks could reach approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025—a 300% increase from 2015 levels.
A Microsoft Security survey reveals that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face added challenges due to limited resources and expertise in implementing and managing advanced security solutions to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Fewer than one-third of respondents indicated that their SMBs handle security internally; the majority rely on consultants, managed service providers, or cyber insurance guidelines for choosing security tools.
AI Meets Cybercrime
As AI technology advances, data privacy and risk management concerns are escalating for individuals and businesses alike. Although regulators are exploring strategies to foster AI innovation while minimizing potential negative impacts on society, the United States still lacks comprehensive federal legislation addressing AI.
AI is transforming the cybersecurity landscape from both the threat and defense perspectives, creating a long-term growth path. “Cyber threats continue to evolve, and as digital transformation accelerates, so does the potential for cyberattacks,” noted Christopher Gilchrist, principal analyst at Forrester. Earlier this year, The World Economic Forum predicted that AI could push cyber incidents and data breaches to hit record levels in 2024, following a 72% year-over-year rise in breaches in the past year.
Nonetheless, the technology holds transformative potential for security. Palo Alto Networks remarked that 2024 “will be a phenomenal year in the utilization of AI in cybersecurity,” yet predicts even greater advances in the future. For investors, this growth represents an intriguing opportunity. According to Acumen research, the global market for AI-driven cybersecurity products was valued at around $15 billion in 2021, with projections to reach approximately $135 billion by 2030. AI’s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns makes it especially effective for tasks like penetration testing, where systems are deliberately probed for vulnerabilities. By deploying AI tools to assess their own technology, organizations can identify weaknesses proactively—closing gaps before hackers have the chance to exploit them.

The constant evolution of external threats means that cybersecurity must continually adapt to stay ahead of emerging risks, with the top players racing to deliver innovative solutions to remain competitive.

Our Methodology
To compile our list of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks this year, we reviewed the holdings of various cybersecurity ETFs and sorted them by year-to-date performance, as of November 8, in ascending order. Additionally, we included hedge fund sentiment on each stock to provide further context and insight into each company's outlook.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)
Year-to-Date Performance as of November 8: 33.67%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity solutions, offering products like identity management, threat intelligence, and detection. Its primary offering, the AI-native Falcon platform, achieved impressive growth at 80% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.
Earlier this July, a faulty software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) triggered widespread technology outages across multiple industries, causing the company's shares to plunge nearly 44% within two weeks, bottoming out in early August. Despite this setback, CrowdStrike’s stock has been on a steady recovery, though it hasn’t yet returned to its pre-incident highs. Investor sentiment around the company has turned optimistic, with 34 Wall Street analysts rating the stock a Buy and only six as Hold.
CrowdStrike’s strong fiscal second quarter of 2025, which ended shortly after the incident, fueled much of this optimism. The company reported a 32% year-over-year revenue increase and turned an operating profit compared to a loss in the same period the prior year. Net income per share rose to $0.19 from just $0.03 a year earlier. While Falcon’s performance continues to drive subscriptions, the company's executives are targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2029, a goal that looks achievable as it focuses on margin improvements.
ClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, came under pressure following a software content update in July that caused widespread disruptions across its client base. Importantly, the outage was not caused by a security breach and we are encouraged that the company was swift and transparent in its response and support for customers. While some level of recompense will be required, after ongoing dialogue with company management, we are optimistic that thoughtful remediation efforts, such as offering flexibility around new module uptakes, will position the company well for future growth. Shares have since rebounded on the back of better than feared channel feedback, which suggests CrowdStrike remains a best-in-class provider in the eyes of customers.”

20241121,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 points to a change of +18.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
CrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
CrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC). These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Broadcom’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company’s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.
However, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom’s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.
(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)
Merck’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.
Yet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.
(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)
Shares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.
Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.
However, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space. The company formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions.

Shares of Natural Health Trends have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+1.8% vs. +21.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, a declining active member base remains the biggest concern for the company. It faces liquidity challenges and high operating expenses. Dependency on key markets and intense competition pose additional risks.
However, expansion into new markets and improvement in cost management bode well.

20241121,AVGO,"Investor confidence in certain major companies has propelled markets higher, but there are also those betting against big-name stocks through short selling amid continued uncertainty.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly topped the 6,000-point mark in the recent rally following Donald Trump's election win, though they have since eased back, with the main US index closing Wednesday's session flat at 5,917.
While markets broadly rose following the US election, there were a particular group of stocks that rallied in what has been dubbed the ""Trump trade"", around expectations as to the policies that the Republican president-elect could look to implement after he returns to the White House in January.
One of which was Tesla (TSLA), as the electric carmaker's CEO Elon Musk was a major supporter of Trump's campaign and has since been nominated by the president-elect to co-lead the recently announced Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
Read more: FTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win
The post-election rally in Tesla stock pushed its market valuation to over the $1tn mark, which was welcome news for investors that are bullish about the company's prospects.
However, not all investors were reaping the benefits, as data from S3 Partners showed that short-sellers had lost nearly $8bn by the Monday after the election, according to Business Insider.
Unlike the traditional way of investing in markets by buying shares with the goal of selling them at a higher price, also known as going ""long"", short selling aims to make a profit on the declining price of the stock. An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them. The hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.
And while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.
Analysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in the last month.
Here are the major companies that have become popular shorts.
Popular short stocks
S3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.
Story continues
Chipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.
The demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.
At the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.
Shares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.
And Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.

The discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.
Tesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.
However, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve ""slight growth"" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.
S3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).
Following its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.
S&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this ""may be related to the [US] election"".
They said that despite this significant activity in ""all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses"".
Global short bets
Meanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.
The data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on ""crowdedness"", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors’ supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.
LVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.
The company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an ""uncertain economic and geopolitical environment"" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.

The luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.
Kering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.
Shares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.
Multinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.
Diageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.
It has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.
In South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.
Read more: What we know about planned UK private stock market Pisces
Hindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were ""nothing but a lie"".
On Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.
Shares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.
In a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were ""baseless"".
Hindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.
However, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.

20241121,AVGO,"The Computer and Technology group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Computer and Technology peers, we might be able to answer that question.
Broadcom Inc. is a member of our Computer and Technology group, which includes 619 different companies and currently sits at #2 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Broadcom Inc. is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO's full-year earnings has moved 5% higher within the past quarter. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.
According to our latest data, AVGO has moved about 46.3% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, the Computer and Technology sector has returned an average of 28.4% on a year-to-date basis. This shows that Broadcom Inc. is outperforming its peers so far this year.
One other Computer and Technology stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is American Superconductor (AMSC). The stock is up 179.7% year-to-date.
The consensus estimate for American Superconductor's current year EPS has increased 117.7% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
Breaking things down more, Broadcom Inc. is a member of the Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which includes 44 individual companies and currently sits at #146 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has gained an average of 42.8% so far this year, so AVGO is performing better in this area.
In contrast, American Superconductor falls under the Electronics - Miscellaneous Components industry. Currently, this industry has 28 stocks and is ranked #52. Since the beginning of the year, the industry has moved +7.6%.
Broadcom Inc. and American Superconductor could continue their solid performance, so investors interested in Computer and Technology stocks should continue to pay close attention to these stocks.

20241121,AVGO,"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?
When Is Debt A Problem?
Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.
Check out our latest analysis for Broadcom
How Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?
The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.
NasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024
How Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?
We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.
Of course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.
In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).
Story Continues
Broadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.
Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.
Our View
When it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.
When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt. Readers can access a list of growth stocks with zero net debt 100% free, right now.

As NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market—and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO).
What To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry.
Broadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers—critical components for Nvidia’s AI-focused operations.

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.
This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.
A strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.
Historically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia’s during major market reactions. Nvidia’s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.
How To Buy AVGO Stock
By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.
Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.
If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

Economic data releases and earnings
Chip stocks are down 3% since the election. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure.
Once the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months.
Nvidia (NVDA) earnings — coming after the bell Wednesday — will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally.

Tom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday.
""It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,"" said Essaye. ""It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.""
Nvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock — up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years — hit record highs following the election.
But many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.
Semiconductor returns during the second half of 2024
The worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.
Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor — is down 14%.
The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous.

To be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday.
""Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],"" said Essaye.
Since the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia — ""priced to perfection"" according to many analysts — underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.
Story Continues
But Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this ""bellwether"" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.
""They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far,"" he said. ""I think they can do it again.""

20241121,AVGO,"We recently compiled a list of the Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.
When it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there’s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University’s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).
Founded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university’s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard’s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard’s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university’s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard’s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.
According to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia’s 11.5% or Brown’s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC’s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:
“In FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC’s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.”
Notably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from ""overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500."" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar’s strategy of overhauling the university’s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Harvard Management Company's Stake: $89.6 million
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the world’s largest technology companies, with operations spanning the hardware and software sectors. The company’s primary strength is in hardware, as it supplies networking and custom chips across diverse applications.
In its third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and robust non-AI semiconductor sales. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI revenue to grow 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the annual AI revenue to $12 billion, largely fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.
On November 6, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company’s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing “seasonal headwinds” linked to a product transition for Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.
Overall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's ""easy"" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some ""serious gains.""
""I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It’s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don’t count. But that, people, is nonsense.""
Cramer said banks do not ""care"" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.
""I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I’m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.""

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.
The company’s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“We continued to build our position in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers – such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few – will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA’s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.”
Overall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

20241121,AVGO,"Broadcom: 3 Reasons We Love This Stock
Broadcom currently trades at $165.14 and has been a dream stock for shareholders. It’s returned 431% since November 2019, blowing past the S&P 500’s 87.9% gain. The company has also beaten the index over the past six months as its stock price is up 16.8%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.
Is now still a good time to buy AVGO? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it’s free.
Why Is AVGO a Good Business?
Originally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.
1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum
A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Over the last five years, Broadcom grew its sales at an excellent 16% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).
Broadcom Quarterly Revenue
2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable
Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.
Broadcom’s management team is currently guiding for a 50.6% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect Broadcom’s revenue to grow 24.6% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus its 21.6% annualized growth rate for the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and implies its newer products and services will catalyze higher growth rates.
3. Excellent Free Cash Flow Boosts Reinvestment Potential
Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.
Broadcom has shown terrific cash profitability, and if sustainable, puts it in an advantageous position to invest in new products, return capital to investors, and consolidate the market during industry downturns. The company’s free cash flow margin was among the best in the semiconductor sector, averaging an eye-popping 43.8% over the last two years.

20241121,AVGO,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this chipmaker have returned -8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Broadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 points to a change of +14% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Broadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Broadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Nvidia (NVDA) mania is heating up ahead of the market darling's earnings report on Wednesday.
The company is “representative of the most important stocks in America,” EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below).
Jackson reiterated his call that Nvidia's stock could double within the next 12 months given its wide lead in artificial intelligence chip production.
“The investments [in AI] are just getting started,” Jackson added. “The need for these chips is still going to continue for the next year or two or three.”
Nvidia's stock has surged more than 2,600% in the past five years, according to Yahoo Finance data, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabbed the top position in cutting-edge chips.
The company's strong performance is expected to continue in its fiscal third quarter — sales and profits are each estimated to be up 83% from a year ago. Wall Street remains bullish on its favorite stock.

Of the 63 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 59 rate the stock a Buy or Strong Buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. The average price target stands at $160.38, about 13% above current levels.
""We see the near-term risks as largely balanced and we are buyers of Nvidia heading into its fiscal third quarter earnings report scheduled for Wednesday,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a client note on Monday. ""Positive set-up indicators from accelerating bookings at cloud service providers, an upward bias on hyper-scale capital expenditures, as well as our view that near-term estimates will increase post the earnings call.""
Lipacis said that if Nvidia were to let investors down, it would come in the form of decelerating revenue growth.

There has been a whirlwind of activity around Nvidia as of late.
In addition to achieving the world's most valuable company status by nudging out Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG), Nvidia joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Nov. 8. Former chip leader Intel (INTC) was kicked out.
“It’s good that Nvidia is part of the mix now,” Jackson said, noting it could encourage purchases from retail investors.
One potential hiccup is the restrictions around selling to China by the Biden administration and subsequent write-downs, which were a “meaningful part of their quarterly earnings,” Jackson said. “They had to take it down to zero.”

Incoming president Donald Trump could stay firm on the chip issue as well, making good on his campaign promises around China.
""The good news for investors is that they’ve written everything down and so if anything comes from the relationship with China and Nvidia, it’s going to be great,” Jackson said.
Wall Street will be hard-pressed to downgrade Nvidia's stock in the medium term.

20241121,AVGO,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Predictive Analytics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.
Data is at the forefront of many inventions today and is the primary ingredient of innovation. Of the many branches of data usage, predictive analytics is garnering immense traction, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistics, modeling, and machine learning to forecast, predict, and plan future events. There are different types of predictive analytics including regression analysis, time-series analysis, and machine learning algorithms.
According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics market was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023. The global predictive analytics market is expected to grow to $95.3 billion by 2032 from $18.02 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%. The report attributes the growth in the industry to the growing investments in data by the government and large corporations followed by IoT and AI integrations. The use of predictive analytics is bifurcated into multiple segments including life sciences, automotive, retail, energy, telecom, and healthcare, to name a few.
Startups Disrupting the Predictive Analytics Space
There are a range of startups in the predictive analytics space that are revolutionizing the industry. One such name is Pecan AI. The automated predictive analytics platform is developed and designed intricately to meet the needs of data scientists. Data scientists can use the platform to build powerful predictive AI capabilities and machine learning models that drive business impact. Data scientists do not need coding or data science skills to make use of the platform. The platform is used by a range of companies including Johnson & Johnson, SciPlay, Hydrant, Kenvue, Proper Cloth, and DME Acquire. Earlier in January, the company introduced predictive generative AI to transform enterprises. Pecan AI also has partnerships with some of the largest tech corporations and platforms including Azure and AWS.
DataRobot is another leader in the predictive analytics industry that delivers revolutionary AI use cases for businesses. Its AI platform consists of core AI features such as generative AI, predictive AI, AI governance, AI observability, and AI foundation. The platform promises 83% faster deployment and secures nearly 1.4 billion predictions every day. Users can run models in minutes by skipping manual data preparation and cleaning. Additionally, the platform eliminates the need for repetitive coding, by streamlining feature discovery and defining elements of datasets automatically. Users can connect data from warehouses such as AWS and Azure into a singular workspace. Some of the predictive use cases facilitated by DataRobot include time series modeling, clustering and seasonality, cold start forecasting, nowcasting, and anomaly detection.

Now that we have studied the predictive analytics industry and some revolutionary startups, let’s take a look at the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now.
Our Methodology
To come up with the 10 best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now we went through multiple reports on the internet, ETFs, and stock screeners. We then examined the analyst upside of each stock and ranked the ones with the highest percentage. Our list is in ascending order of the analyst upside as of November 11, 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Predictive Analytics Stock to Invest in Now?
A data analyst working at a computer, crunching numbers for the company's 80% total assets.
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Analyst upside as of November 11, 2024: 12%
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs and develops a range of semiconductor products and is well known for making application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also provides infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. The company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless markets.
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) offers predictive analytics through its Automation Analytics and Intelligence platform. The platform offers workload automation solutions supported by a predictive analytics workload platform allowing entities to visualize data and manage complex workloads that facilitate the development of crucial business insights.
Some key features of the platform by Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) include cross-platform visibility, dynamic service level management, enhanced workload analytics, business monitoring, enhanced change control, and dynamic critical path discovery. All these features combined put AVGO ahead of its competitors.
Overall, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a rapidly growing company with expertise in ASICs, infrastructure software, and data analytics, contributing to its ranking on our list. Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their median price target of $200 implies an upside of 12%, as of November 11.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“We continued to build our position in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers – such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few – will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA’s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.”
Overall, AVGO ranks 8th on our list of best predictive analytics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241121,AVGO,"It's been a soft week for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares, which are down 10%. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been spectacular. To be precise, the stock price is 423% higher than it was five years ago, a wonderful performance by any measure. So it might be that some shareholders are taking profits after good performance. The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain.
While the stock has fallen 10% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.
See our latest analysis for Broadcom
In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Over half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.5% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 39% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 140.31.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
NasdaqGS:AVGO Earnings Per Share Growth November 16th 2024
Dive deeper into Broadcom's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Broadcom's earnings, revenue and cash flow.
What About Dividends?
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Broadcom's TSR for the last 5 years was 507%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
A Different Perspective
We're pleased to report that Broadcom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 71% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 43%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.

In recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.
""We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously”
Helberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.

This news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a “wall”. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI’s Orion is “so far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI’s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.”
However, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is “no wall”. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it’s possible to have reached a turning point.
“We haven’t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we’ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.”
Gary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:
“The economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense…”

20241121,NOW,"ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
ROE can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:
14% = US$1.3b ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.
What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
ServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE
To start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.
NYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.

Is ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?
ServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Conclusion
On the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.

20241121,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:
“When it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.”

Cramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.
Another sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.
While some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.
Similarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they’re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.
As for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they’ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.

“We need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we’re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.”

Cramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.’s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:
“Let's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive… Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market… Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting… Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again… Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.
Additionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company’s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.
Overall NOW ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

Sovereign AI: a new concept gaining traction in the realm of artificial intelligence. As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing “sovereign” artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to “codify” a country’s culture, history, and collective intelligence.

That said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent’s competitiveness and technological resilience.
Filippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they “understand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.”
“As this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.”
While AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.
Latest Advancements in AI
In recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon’s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe’s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world’s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.
“WoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification”.
Story Continues
Other fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.
In other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed “Operator”, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. The planned release is part of a wider industry movement towards agents—AI software capable of performing multi-step tasks for users with minimal oversight.

20241121,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.
Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday’s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there’s a catch.
“What if the Treasury doesn’t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.”
READ ALSO Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks and Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins
Even though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.
Cramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump’s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board—on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains—no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it’s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:
“If it’s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses… It has always worked for the stock market.”
But Cramer warned that there’s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market’s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.
Story Continues
“If you believe we’re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.”

How ServiceNow Inc (NOW)’s AI Partnerships Are Driving Its Soaring Growth: Insights from Jim Cramer
A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.
ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)
Talking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:
“As is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn’t make a lot of sense and… we’re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company’s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia’s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.
This partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.
For the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%. The company also expects a gross profit margin of 84.5% for its subscription services, with an operating income margin of 29.5% and a free cash flow margin of 31%.
Overall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks.

20241121,NOW,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL –November 15, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Toast TOST, as the Bull of the Day and Clean Harbors CLH, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Toast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.
The stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock’s ongoing upward momentum.
About the Company
Toast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.
With its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.
Its platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.
Toast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.
The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “A” in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a “F” in Value.
Q3 Earnings Beat
On November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.
Q3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.
The company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.
Gross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.
Management comments were overwhelmingly bullish:
“Toast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.”
Estimates Headed Higher
Analysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.
Story Continues
For the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.
For the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.
For the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.
Toast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote
With the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.
JPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.
The Technical Take
The stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO’d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.
After trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.
With the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.
Post earnings low: $36
Gap fill: $33
21-day: $32
50-day: $29.20
200-day: $25.20
Fibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32
While that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.
In Summary
Toast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.
The company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.
As Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.
Bear of the Day:
Clean Harbors  is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.
The company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?
With an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.
About the Company
Clean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).
The company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world’s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.
CLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “D” in Value, But “B” in both Momentum and Growth.
Q3 Earnings
The company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.
Despite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.
Positive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.
While there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.
Earnings Estimates
Estimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.
For the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.
Looking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.
For the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year’s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.
Technical Take
The drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.
This volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.
The drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.
The stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.
In Summary
Clean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.
With significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.

NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.
The strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.
In third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.
NOW’s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation
However, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.
In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector’s 6.37X.
We believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow’s premium valuation.
Conclusion
ServiceNow’s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.
ServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241121,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.
Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ to discuss the market’s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we’ve had some ""very good"" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.

Hickey’s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.
Developments in the AI Landscape
With AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn’t anyone who doesn’t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the “Future 40”. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.
Artificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure”, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China’s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act “as ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.”
Story Continues
As per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden’s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments “to give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure”, amongst other things.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Strong Portfolio Aids NOW’s Prospects

Strong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive

NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.

The strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.

20241121,NOW,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
ServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
Story Continues
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Should You Invest in NOW?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

20241121,NOW,"Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
ServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.
Insiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).
ServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock
The last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.
Insider Ownership Of ServiceNow
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About ServiceNow Insiders?
Insiders sold ServiceNow shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for ServiceNow you should be aware of.

One conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC’s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.

Nevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity’s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn’t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.
While that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.
“The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever”.
In light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called ""time testing compute"" for improving models during the “inference” phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.
Recent AI Developments
Fortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry’s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.
Story Continues
In its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn’t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot’s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.
In other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.
“Ad programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.”

20241121,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Will Go Higher in Trump Presidency. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer.
In a recent program, Jim Cramer celebrated the market’s rally on Donald Trump’s election victory, saying the market likes Trump.
“The market likes Donald J. Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?”
Cramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.
“Trump wants to cut taxes—all taxes—including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It’s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that’s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.”
Cramer said the market is still “oversold” as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground. However, Cramer said the polls were again proved wrong.
Cramer then talked about the stocks that investors can buy to ride the Trump rally.

20241121,NOW,"ServiceNow (NOW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which ServiceNow falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
ServiceNow is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.6%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $13.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. This estimate has changed +4.2% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of +18.3% from what ServiceNow is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ServiceNow is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
Story Continues
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of ServiceNow, the consensus sales estimate of $2.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $10.97 billion and $13.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.3% and +20.1%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
ServiceNow reported revenues of $2.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.3%. EPS of $3.72 for the same period compares with $2.92 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.06%. The EPS surprise was +7.51%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
ServiceNow is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ServiceNow. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

""Organizations know they need to deliver seamless customer experiences. But most CRM solutions only focus on capturing customer requests, not fulfilling or resolving them. As a result, human middleware ties manual processes and siloed technologies together,"" said John Ball, senior vice president, Customer and Industry Workflows at ServiceNow. ""ServiceNow Customer Service Management is different. We focus on driving great customer service experiences with workflows, automation, and GenAI that enable seamless self-service and assisted service across voice and digital channels.

The new AI-powered solution will boost agent efficiency with real-time transcription, unified routing, and a consolidated agent workspace.
Real-time Transcription – Five9 TranscriptStream will be integrated into ServiceNow Interaction Management, allowing agents to focus fully on customer issues without needing to take notes. ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by GenAI, uses these transcriptions to generate summaries and resolution notes, reducing call wrap-up activities and average handling times. This not only makes agents’ work easier and faster, but also gives managers insights into service trends, helping them improve training and processes to better meet customer needs.
Unified Routing – Five9’s intelligent automated routing engine will now be able to route ServiceNow digital channels and cases, alongside Five9 channels, to the right agent, leveraging ServiceNow metadata. The metadata from ServiceNow will also enrich data in Workforce Engagement Management solutions offered by Five9. This reduces operational overhead for managers through streamlined routing management across both systems, making it easier to adjust staffing during high-demand periods. It also provides comprehensive insights to improve forecasting and scheduling, ultimately reducing operational costs.
Single Agent Experience – Native Call Controls within ServiceNow’s Agent Workspace will integrate with Five9, meaning agents can handle Five9 interactions directly in the Universal Agent Inbox. This provides one, consistent agent experience across digital and voice channels. Native Call Controls will seamlessly work with other Agent Workspace features, providing agents with a single pane of glass, offering immediate context on the caller, relevant data from different systems, actionable guidance, and the ability to quickly fulfill the customer’s request. These capabilities are designed to support high-volume contact centers, making it easier for agents to understand and quickly fulfill complex inquiries requiring agent assistance.

20241122,META,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.
Technology giants in the United States have pledged tens of billions towards building AI data centers in the next few years. These announcements have served to bolster the hype around companies that build data centers. For example, Crusoe Energy, a startup building data centers for large AI firms, plans to raise more than $800 million in funding, per regulatory filings. The filings detail that the company has already raised close to $685 million of the $818 million in total that it is seeking, with seventy investors contributing to the funding. Crusoe is one of many crypto-origin firms that have pivoted to AI in recent months.

A report by consulting firm McKinsey reveals that global demand for data center capacity could rise at an annual rate of between 19%-22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts. McKinsey analysis suggests that demand for AI-ready data center capacity will rise at an average rate of 33% a year between 2023 and 2030 in a midrange scenario. Per the consulting firm, this means that around 70% of total demand for data center capacity will be for data centers equipped to host advanced-AI workloads by 2030. Gen AI, currently the fastest-growing advanced-AI use case, will account for around 40 percent of the total, the report underlines.

20241122,META,"We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks on the list.
With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least.
Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71,  the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence.
Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns.
As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade.
GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.”
Story Continues
Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.”
While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%.
Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.”

Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.”
Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.”
Our Methodology
To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the world’s biggest social media company. Courtesy of its social media network Facebook, the firm can boast about having a whopping 3.2 billion users under its wing. This massive user base is also at the center of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s hypothesis. It makes the firm indispensable to advertisers who have no choice but to run ads on its platform if they want to capture sizable users. The scale has enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to amass significant resources, as evident through its $156 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue and $43.9 billion in cash and equivalent. The firm has used these to create a foothold in the AI industry by developing the Llama foundational AI model. Unlike other big tech players which are gearing their AI products towards cloud computing, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is targeting everyday consumers and advertisers on its platform. The billions it has invested in AI means that investors are on the watch-out for profit generation.
Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”
Overall, META ranks 26th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241122,META,"(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by Meta Platforms Inc., leaving it to face a multibillion-dollar lawsuit that accuses the company of misleading shareholders about the data-harvesting scandal involving political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.

Investors claim the company, then known as Facebook, inflated share prices through misleading disclosures about the risk of the scandal leading to the misuse of user data. The shareholders say revelations about the breach eventually contributed to two 2018 price drops that cost the company more than $200 billion in market value.
Meta was seeking reversal of a federal appeals court decision that had let the lawsuit go forward. The Supreme Court agreed to consider the appeal in June and heard arguments on Nov. 6.
The court occasionally drops cases after argument. As is its usual practice, the court provided no explanation, saying only that the case was being “dismissed as improvidently granted.”
The dismissal makes it more likely Meta will face a costly settlement — potentially as large as $2 billion — according to Matthew Schettenhelm, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. A Meta victory at the Supreme Court would have knocked out some though not all of the case against the company.
“The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,” Meta said in a statement. “We are disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision not to clarify this part of the law.”
The attorney for the investors, Kevin Russell, declined to comment.
The case more broadly had the potential to reset the legal rules governing corporate disclosure. Business groups led by the Chamber of Commerce had urged the court to side with Meta, saying that risk-disclosure allegations have contributed to a wave of meritless securities-fraud suits.
The Securities and Exchange Commission since 2005 has required companies to disclose material factors that would make an investment risky.
The Supreme Court is also considering an appeal by AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp., which is being sued for allegedly misleading shareholders about its reliance on crypto-mining revenue in the run-up to a market crash.
Story Continues
Cambridge Analytica
The first hint of the Cambridge Analytica controversy came in December 2015, when The Guardian reported that the British firm was using a database of information gleaned from Facebook users to help the presidential primary campaign of Senator Ted Cruz. At the time, Facebook said it was investigating.
The suing shareholders say Facebook quickly concluded that Cambridge Analytica had obtained the private information of more than 30 million users without their consent.
But the shareholders say the company publicly characterized the risk of a breach as hypothetical and didn’t change that stance until March 2018, when it issued a statement to preempt more far-reaching stories in The New York Times and The Guardian. The investors say those revelations caused the share price to plunge.
The shareholders say the company’s inadequate disclosures also contributed to a July 2018 stock plunge that at the time was the largest one-day drop in value in US history.
The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the allegations were sufficient to let the lawsuit go forward.
Meta said it had no reason to think the scandal would harm the company because details had already been published without any impact on the stock price. Meta said the 9th Circuit’s reasoning would require companies to disclose risks that occurred years earlier even if they don’t pose any known current threat of business harm.
The Biden administration backed the shareholders at the Supreme Court.
The case is Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, 23-980.

Merely days after Donald Trump won a tightly-contested election for the top office in the US, Elon Musk, one of his most prominent backers, received further good news as xAI, the AI startup he founded in 2023, raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. News publication The Wall Street Journal reported that Valor Equity Partners, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz were part of the raise, while the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar also participated in the funding process. This set of investors had also backed the startup with $6 billion in funding earlier this year.

20241122,META,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent Meta, stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.
The justices heard arguments in November in Meta's bid to shut down the lawsuit. On Friday, they decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place.
The high court dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.
Investors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users’ personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump ’s first successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.
Inadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company’s shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.
Meta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court's action. “The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,” Stone said in an emailed statement.
Meta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.
Cambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.
The lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also are wrestling with whether to shut down a class action against Nvidia. Investors say the company misled them about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency.

20241122,META,"By John Kruzel
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court sidestepped on Friday a decision on whether to allow shareholders to proceed with a securities fraud lawsuit accusing Meta's Facebook of misleading investors about the misuse of the social media platform's user data.
The justices, who heard arguments in the case on Nov. 6, dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court's ruling that allowed a 2018 class action led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed. The Supreme Court opted not to resolve the underlying legal dispute, determining that the case should not have been taken up. Its action leaves the lower court's decision in place.
The court's dismissal came in a one-line order that provided no explanation.
The Facebook dispute was one of two cases to come before the Supreme Court this month involving the right of private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud. The other one, involving the artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, was argued on Nov. 13. The Supreme Court has not ruled yet in the Nvidia case.
The plaintiffs in the Facebook case claimed the company unlawfully withheld information from investors about a 2015 data breach involving British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica that affected more than 30 million Facebook users. They accused Facebook of misleading investors in violation of the Securities Exchange Act, a 1934 federal law that requires publicly traded companies to disclose their business risks.
Facebook's stock fell following 2018 media reports that Cambridge Analytica had used improperly harvested Facebook user data in connection with Donald Trump's successful U.S. presidential campaign in 2016. The investors have sought unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Facebook stock they held.
At issue was whether Facebook broke the law when it failed to detail the prior data breach in subsequent business-risk disclosures, and instead portrayed the risk of such incidents as purely hypothetical.
Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone expressed disappointment ""in the Supreme Court's decision not to clarify this part of the law.""
""The plaintiff's claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,"" Stone said.
Facebook argued that it was not required to reveal that its warned-of risk had already materialized because ""a reasonable investor"" would understand risk disclosures to be forward-looking statements.
President Joe Biden's administration supported the shareholders in the case.
Story Continues
U.S. District Judge Edward Davila dismissed the lawsuit but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived it, prompting Facebook's appeal to the Supreme Court.
George Washington University law professor Alan Morrison said that following the Supreme Court's dismissal of Facebook's appeal, the plaintiffs would be expected to seek discovery, a process that involves the exchange of information among parties in a case. Morrison added that Facebook ""might renew their motion to dismiss under a somewhat different standard - partially for purposes of delay.""
The Cambridge Analytica data breach prompted U.S. government investigations into Facebook's privacy practices, various lawsuits and a U.S. congressional hearing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 brought an enforcement action against Facebook over the matter, which the company settled for $100 million. Facebook paid a separate $5 billion penalty to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the issue.
The Supreme Court in prior rulings has limited the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that polices securities fraud.

Founded by Alex Hawkinson, an entrepreneur and investor with a proven track record in the tech world, the company offers an end-to-end tech platform that uses sensors to help companies monitor physical assets. These sensors send data to an AI algorithm that processes it and can help predict potential issues before they arise.

Tech news website TechCrunch reports that the startup first launched this product in 2023. Since then, the firm has managed to attract seven large enterprise customers across six verticals, including HVAC, waste management, and power. It has deployed more than 250,000 sensors and has reached $80 million in revenue. These figures are impressive since the startup managed to do this without raising any outside capital. However, the firm is now looking to expand and recently raised more than $15 million in a funding round led exclusively by Los Angeles-based Upfront Ventures.

20241122,META,"Nvidia (NVDA) is assuaging Wall Street’s concerns about any potential slowdowns in the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip, telling investors during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday that it’s on pace to exceed its previous revenue estimates for the current quarter.
“Blackwell production is in full steam,” CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.”
Prior to the earnings call, The Information reported on Nov. 17 that Nvidia was contending with overheating issues related to its Blackwell-based servers leading suppliers to adjust the design of the racks that house the servers. Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected.
The report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time.
Now Nvidia is saying that the chips aren’t just shipping, they’re in the hands of all of the company’s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker’s data center revenue. Ensuring they’re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia’s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that.

“With any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,” Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance.
“And I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.”
But there’s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth’s chips makes it difficult to meet demand.
“It is the case that demand exceeds supply,” Huang told analysts. “And that’s expected as we’re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.”

For some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.
The H100 is Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.
Story Continues
As Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need.
“Nvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,” New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. “And so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.”
In its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street’s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday.
This isn’t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company’s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.

It added that in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointing. The ECB further underlined that investors were demanding a low premium to own shares and bonds while funds had cut their cash buffers. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments, the ECB said.

20241122,AAPL,"Economists say Britain’s private sector companies have given a ‘thumbs down’ to Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer’s Budget - Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing Street
Economists have sounded the alarm over a UK recession after data showed Britain’s economy was reeling from the effects of Rachel Reeves’s tax-raising Budget.
Britain is now “close to stagnation” after closely watched PMI figures showed activity among the UK’s private sector companies shrank for the first time in more than a year in November.
Sterling dropped to its lowest against the dollar since May and banking stocks plunged on Friday. Economists said they were “more worried” that Britain’s performance might not be as good as previous forecasts.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: “Companies are giving a clear ‘thumbs down’ to the policies announced in the Budget, especially the planned increase in employers’ National Insurance contributions.”
The warning came as:
Retail sales slumped by more than expected in October as uncertainty about the Budget held back consumer spending
Traders bet that the Bank of England will cut interest rates at least three times next year, up from a prediction of at least two on Thursday
Bank stocks sank to the bottom of the FTSE 100 amid expectations of lower rates
Bond yields fell as traders raced to buy up government debt ahead of the expected rate cuts.
While most economists said they do not think the UK is heading for recession, they were clear that the latest data raised the risks of Britain’s economy contracting.
Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “Our forecasts assume that economic growth improves a bit in Q4 and strengthens further next year, partly due to the rises in government spending announced in the Budget.
“But I am now more worried that economic growth will be weaker than our forecasts.
“And at this stage, it would no longer be a surprise if the economy contracted in Q4.
“Any recession, though, would presumably be short and small as the drag on the economy from higher interest rates should now be fading.”
Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “UK growth certainly slowed over the summer and we have had a couple of disappointing months. We were close to stalling in October.”
He added: “There’s any number of risks. We think growth will improve from here but growth could be worse than that.”

Pub industry urges Reeves to delay £500m tax hike
The pub industry has today urged Rachel Reeves to delay the introduction of at least £500m of extra costs on the industry.
Story continues
The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said that pubs were responsible for 1 in 10 of all under 25-year-olds in employment. But it warned that the Budget would mean pubs would damage the employment prospects of young people.
The trade body said:
Prior to the Budget, the National Insurance contributions for 350,000 under 25-year-olds was equal to approximately £82m. With the new NICs announced in the Budget, this will now cost a staggering £153m to maintain the same amount of under 25-year-old workers...
The Times reported that the association had said that brewers’ profits could be “wiped out” by the Budget’s extra costs.

Wall Street rises on signs of robust US economy
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones hovered at levels seen more than a week ago on Friday, as investors took comfort from data pointing to robust economic activity in the world’s biggest economy.
The domestically focused small-cap Russell 2000 index outperformed large-cap indexes with a 1.6pc rise. The index hit a more than one-week high and was set for weekly advances of around 4pc.
A measure of business activity raced to a 31-month high in November, boosted by hopes for lower interest rates and more business-friendly policies from President-elect Donald Trump’s administration next year.
“It’s the excitement about the deregulation and the Trump activity that will boost economic action, because executives start making moves ahead of things,” said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer at The Patriarch Organization.
However, Mr Schiffer said strong economic data could make the Fed consider a slower pace of monetary policy easing.
The S&P 500 rose 0.3pc, the Dow Jones rose 0.7pc and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.1pc.

Weaker pound takes FTSE 100 to best week in six months
The FTSE 100 recorded its biggest weekly gain in more than six months on Friday as a slide in sterling supported dollar earners, while banks came under pressure from weak business activity data.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day 1.4pc higher, and logged a 2.5pc weekly rise, its best since May 7.
The pound tumbled 0.6pc to $1.25105 per dollar, its weakest since May, after data showed British business output in November shrank for the first time in more than a year, and retail sales also fell by much more than expected in October.
The currency’s decline helped lift shares of UK-listed international firms such as AstraZeneca, Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser, which draw a major portion of their revenue overseas.
Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, announced a budget in late October which raised taxes on business and the wealthy, contributing to the first contraction in private sector activity in over a year.
“So, all this points to uncertainty and sort of a fragile outlook for the UK as a whole,” said Daniel Coatsworth&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;, investment analyst at AJ Bell.
“But overall, it’s a strange situation where you have lots of negative economic data points that’s weakened the pound, but is really good for the large amount of overseas focus companies that are listed in London.”
However, banks including Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group dropped between 0.3pc and 2.1pc, weighed down by the gloomy data.
Traders expect the Bank of England to hold interest rates next month, but see more cuts coming next year. They now expect about 0.72 percentage points worth of cuts next year, compared with 0.67 percentage points before the release of the data.

Unilever to slim down food business in quest for better returns
Unilever is to “prune” its food brands, its chief executive has said, as the company seeks to deliver “higher performance with market-making, unmissably superior brands”.
Hein Schumacher, chief executive, told the Financial Times: “I believe in fewer, bigger, better ... and that is what we choose to execute on.”
The British company, which plans to dispose of its ice-cream division next year, has delivered a relatively stagnant share price since 2017. This prompted criticism that its had focused too much on “social purpose” rather than business performance.
Investment manager Terry Smith of Fundsmith said: “A company which feels it has to define the purpose of Hellmann’s mayonnaise has in our view clearly lost the plot.
Unilever subsequently changed course under new leadership, with Mr Schumacher saying the company would stop “force fitting” ideas about social purpose to all its brands.

FTSE 100 closes up, helped by slide in sterling
The FTSE 100 jumped 1.4pc today, as a slide in sterling supported companies earning in dollars, while banks came under pressure from weak business activity data.
The pound is down by more than 0.5pc today and by around 0.8pc since Monday.
The top riser in the index was the conglomerate Diploma, which rose 5.8pc, followed by engineering business Spirax, up 4.3pc.
At the other end of the index, NatWest lost 2.5pc, while Barclays fell 2.1pc.
Meanwhile, the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 1.1pc, with Games Warehouse the highest riser, gaining 17.3pc, and shipping company Clarkson adding 9.3pc.
City firm CMC Markets was the largest faller, down 8.5pc, followed by Close Brothers, which lost 6.5pc.

Thales denies wrongdoing as bribery investigation hits shares
A key supplier to the Armed Forces has said it denies unspecified allegations after the Serious Fraud Office announced an investigation into suspected bribery and corruption.
Thales, which is Europe’s largest defence technology firm, confirmed that the investigation, jointly by the SFO and France’s PNF financial prosecutor, concerned a contract in Asia. It said the case focused on four entities in France and the UK, without giving further details.
“Thales denies the allegations brought to its knowledge,” the company said.
It did not give any further details of the allegations.
Shares in the company, which is partly owned by the French state, fell as much as 7pc.
A Thales spokesperson said the company was cooperating with the authorities in an investigation related to four of its entities in France and Britain. It said it always complied with national and international laws.
A French judicial source told Reuters that the investigation related to an arms contract in Asia, centring on possible charges of bribery of a foreign public official, influence trafficking, handling stolen goods, and money laundering.
“At this point, the related contract under investigation remains unknown, making any potential assessment of the risk challenging,” Jefferies analysts said in a note.
Thales’ military and civil products range from sub-hunting sonars to biometric identity systems for banks, and from satellites to seat-back entertainment systems for airlines.

EU ready to react if new US trade frictions emerge, says ambassador
The European Union is ready to respond if new trade tensions emerge with Washington, the EU ambassador to the United States said today, two months before Donald Trump takes office.
While the bloc is looking into areas of cooperation, if there are trade frictions “the European Union will be ready, actually, to react,” Jovita Neliupsiene told reporters in Washington.
She called the United States a “credible partner” and pointed to both sides’ historical record of cooperation.
“Even when we had tensions, be it in trade or in some other areas, we always manage to find a way out,” she said.
On the campaign trail, Trump floated across-the-board tariffs of at least 10 percent on imports, in a move that could stoke tensions with allies in Europe.

Gold jumps after Russia fires newly developed weapon
Gold is headed for a strong weekly gain after worries about the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated.
The moves came after the US and UK permitted Kyiv to use their weapons to strike Russian territory and Moscow responded on Thursday by firing what Washington described as a newly developed hypersonic ballistic missile into Dnipro in Ukraine.
Axel Rudolph, Senior Technical Analyst at online trading platform IG, said:
Escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, which triggered safe haven gold inflows, pushed the precious metal price to new all-time highs in euros and the pound sterling. In US dollars, the gold price saw its largest weekly gain in eight months and rose by close to 5pc.
Gold is currently at $2,704.80 an ounce, up 1.2pc today. It started the week at $2,568.50, a rise of 5.3pc.

Britain can learn from US on economy, says think tank
Rachel Reeves’s Budget is already harming the economy but Britain could learn from some of Donald Trump’s policies, according to a leading free-market economist.
Madsen Pirie, president of the Adam Smith Institute, told The Telegraph:
The warning could not be more clear for the UK economy. In the US, business optimism is going like the clappers after Trump won the presidential election. People eagerly await tax cuts and a friendlier regulatory environment and are leaping to take business opportunities.

Bosch to cut 5,500 jobs in further sign of car industry woes
German industrial giant Bosch plans to reduce its automotive division workforce by up to 5,500 jobs in another sign of the headwinds hitting the German and global automotive industries.
The company pointed to stagnating global car sales, too much factory capacity in the car industry compared to sales prospects and a slower than expected transition to electric-powered, software-controlled vehicles.
Some 3,500 of the proposed job reductions will come before the end of 2027 and hit the part of the company that develops advanced driver assistance and automated driving technologies, the company said. About half those job reductions would be at locations in Germany.
The reductions are still in the planning stage. A jobs pact that promised no redundancies in Germany until 2027 for many division employees and until 2029 in some circumstances will remain in effect.

UK watchdog accuses Apple of stifling web browser innovation
The competition watchdog has accused Apple of stifling innovation with its control over web browser technology on iPhones.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that Apple and Google’s policies on iPhones and Android phones respectively are restricting competitors.
A CMA panel recommended that the regulator prioritise investigations into the pair when it assumes new powers in January.
Apple allows rivals to its web browser on the iPhone, but they must use its underlying WebKit software, which rivals say holds them back from making speed and security improvements.
While Google allows alternative engines on Android, it ensures that its Chrome browser is the default. The CMA said it was most concerned with Apple’s conduct.
“Markets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers,” the CMA’s Margot Daly said.
“Through our investigation, we have provisionally found that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK.”
In the EU, Apple has been ordered to allow other browser engines and offer users a choice when they sign up.
Apple said: “We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS. We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart.”

FTSE 100 poised for best week in six months
The FTSE 100 was on track for its strongest week in six months as its stocks were boosted by the falling pound.
The UK’s blue-chip stock index was up as 2.3pc higher so far this week, which would be its best performance since May.
It comes as the pound slumped 0.8pc since Monday and was down about 4pc since the election of Donald Trump on November 5.
The dollar has surged since the US election amid expectations that the president-elect’s policies will be inflationary, forcing the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher.
The FTSE 100 benefits from a strong dollar as most of its companies report their results in the US currency.
The pound was last down 0.6pc to $1.252 against the dollar, its weakest since May.
With that, let me thank you for following today’s live updates from the markets so far, and I will leave you in the good hands of Alex Singleton.

Oil market choppy amid uncertainty over output
Oil prices are experiencing choppy trading today amid uncertainty about the future direction of Brent Crude prices.
Expectations of a glut, amid difficult times for the Chinese economy, are weighing down on oil prices. But a planned increase in output by the Opec+ oil cartel, which was planned for January, could be put on ice.
A Bloomberg survey says that nearly 80pc of traders and analysts believe that the planned increase could be postponed.
Brent crude was risen as much as 0.9pc and lost as much as 1.1pc today, and is currently up 0.5pc. Prices have fallen 8.8pc in the past six months.

US yields jump after strong figures for the private sector
The yield on two-year US Treasury notes jumped this afternoon on the news that growth in business activity among American companies has increased.
The two-year bonds rose to 4.369pc, up from 4.328pc earlier today.
The US Federal Reserve has a dual mandate to promote both stable prices and promote maximum employment. Stronger growth from businesses gives the bank more latitude to keep interest rates higher for longer.
02:52 PM GMT
Trump boosts US private sector businesses
The US has reached a two-and-a-half year high in the growth in its business activity, boosted by positivity from the election of Donald Trump as the next president.
The latest flash US purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data, produced by S&P Global, rose rose to 55.3 in November, up from 54.1 a month earlier.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:
The prospect of lower interest rates and a more pro-business approach from the incoming administration has fueled greater optimism, in turn helping drive output and order book inflows higher in November.

US stocks edge higher ahead of private sector data
Wall Street’s main indexes had a subdued start as investors awaited a business activity survey and monitored geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 points at the open to 43,871.63.
The S&P 500 fell 4.4 points, or 0.1pc, to 5,944.36&ZeroWidthSpace;, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.1 points, or less than 0.1pc, to 18,966.32.

Euro hits two-year low as private sector output shrinks
The euro slumped to its lowest point in two years as traders bet on aggressive interest rate cuts next year.
The single currency fell more than 1pc against the dollar to as low as $1.034 at one stage amid expectations the European Central Bank will cut borrowing costs to boost the eurozone’s struggling economy.
Closely watched PMI data showed that business activity in the bloc contracted for the second time in three months in November.
The market-implied odds of a half-a-percentage-point rate cut - also known as 50 basis points - next month jumped to more than 50pc, up from about 15pc on Thursday.
Matthew Landon, global market strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank, said: “This report truly puts a 50 basis point cut on the table.”
The euro was little changed against the pound as Britain’s economy also suffered a contraction in private sector output. The single currency is worth about 83.3p.
02:15 PM GMT
Markets ‘worried growth will disappoint’
Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at Abrdn, said: “Markets are betting on stagnation and more rate cuts coming.”

The PMI figures have also raised the possibility that Britain could be heading for “stagflation”, a scenario in which economic growth grinds to a halt despite higher inflation, Mr Bartholomew added.

Andrew Wishart, senior UK economist at Berenberg, said: “The market reaction shows that there are worries that growth is going to disappoint.”

Markets are not yet pricing in a recession, however, as interest rates are currently high and sluggish growth would give the Bank of England more scope to cut interest rates which would act as a stimulus, Mr Wishart said.
02:01 PM GMT
Britain faces ‘more underlying weakness than we had thought’
Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “There are good reasons why both the retail sales data and the PMIs may be overstating the weakness.
“The late timing this year meant the school half-term didn’t provide the usual support to retail sales in October. And the PMIs don’t fully capture the recent increases in government spending (they focus on private sector activity).
“Even so, there appears to be more underlying weakness than we had thought. Some of this may be due to the policies announced in the Budget. But since the PMIs in Europe have followed a similar trajectory as in the UK, that’s not the whole story.
“Our forecasts assume that economic growth improves a bit in Q4 and strengthens further next year, partly due to the rises in government spending announced in the Budget.
“But I am now more worried that economic growth will be weaker than our forecasts. And at this stage, it would no longer be a surprise if the economy contracted in Q4.
“Any recession, though, would presumably be short and small as the drag on the economy from higher interest rates should now be fading.”

Recession warning as Britain reels from Reeves’s Budget
Economists have sounded the alarm over a UK recession after data showed Britain’s economy was reeling from the effects of Rachel Reeves’s tax-raising Budget.
Britain is now “close to stagnation” after closely watched PMI figures showed activity among the UK’s private sector companies shrank for the first time in more than a year in November.
Sterling dropped to its lowest against the dollar since May and banking stocks plunged on Friday. Economists said they were “more worried” that Britain’s performance might not be as good as previous forecasts.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: “Companies are giving a clear ‘thumbs down’ to the policies announced in the Budget, especially the planned increase in employers’ National Insurance contributions.”
The warning came as:
Retail sales slumped by more than expected in October as uncertainty about the Budget held back consumer spending
Traders bet that the Bank of England will cut interest rates at least three times next year, up from a prediction of at least two on Thursday
Bank stocks sank to the bottom of the FTSE 100 amid expectations of lower rates
Bond yields fell as traders raced to buy up government debt ahead of the expected rate cuts.
While most economists said they do not think the UK is heading for recession, they were clear that the latest data raised the risks of Britain’s economy contracting.
Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “Our forecasts assume that economic growth improves a bit in Q4 and strengthens further next year, partly due to the rises in government spending announced in the Budget.
“But I am now more worried that economic growth will be weaker than our forecasts.
“And at this stage, it would no longer be a surprise if the economy contracted in Q4.
“Any recession, though, would presumably be short and small as the drag on the economy from higher interest rates should now be fading.”

DFS sales grow despite retail downturn
Retail sales slumped further than expected in October but one retailer appeared to buck the downward trend.
DFS has said sales have improved in recent months, as it also hired a new interim finance boss.
The sofa specialist had suffered a sales slump in late 2023 and earlier this year as shoppers pulled back spending on big ticket items.
Revenues had dropped by almost a tenth in the year to June amid pressure from Red Sea shipping delays and pressure from high interest rates on household finances.
However, it had reported an uptick in performance from July as customer sentiment rebounded.
The London-listed business said today this has continued, with it reporting a growth in orders year-on-year for the 20 weeks since the start of July.
It said this order growth is in line with previous expectations.
DFS said it has also continued to make progress on reducing its cost base. The company has previously laid out plans to secure at least £50m in cost savings by 2026.

US stocks muted ahead of private sector growth figures
Wall Street lacked direction ahead of the opening bell ahead of the latest survey of US private sector activity.
The benchmark S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher on Thursday, with AI bellwether Nvidia managing modest gains after its quarterly results.
Investor attention is now focused on a the S&P Global business activity survey, with forecasts pointing to services activity still in expansion territory, while manufacturing is expected to remain in contraction.
Wall Street’s main indexes are on track to end the week higher amid hopes Donald Trump’s tax and tariff policies will boost corporate profits after his win in the presidential election.
In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1pc and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were down 0.1pc.
01:14 PM GMT
Economy ‘close to stagnation’ as private sector output shrinks
Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: Britain’s economy has certainly slowed. The economy is close to stagnation.
“UK growth certainly slowed over the summer and we have had a couple of disappointing months. We were close to stalling in October.
“We will probably rebound in November. Consumer confidence has picked up.
“I don’t think there is a serious risk of a major recession here but growth has slowed to a crawl.”
12:35 PM GMT
Borrowing costs slump amid rate cut bets
The cost of government borrowing has fallen amid expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates more sharply next year.
The yield on 10-year UK gilts - the return the government promises to buyers of its debt - fell more than five basis points to 4.38pc as traders raced to snap up bonds.
The rally in bond markets comes after weak retail sales figures and PMI data sounded the alarm on the health of the UK economy.
European debt costs were also falling after weak PMI data for the eurozone, potentially pushing central banks to cut interest rates at a faster pace to support growth.
Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said the UK PMI figures were “dismal”.
She said: “UK bond yields are lower across the curve, although European bond yields are leading the charge.”

Ryanair and Easyjet fined over £100m for ‘abusive’ baggage fees
Five budget airlines have been fined €179m (£149m) by the Spanish government for “abusive practices” such as charging passengers for hand luggage.
Ryanair has pledged to appeal the “illegal” penalties issued over the Irish carrier’s baggage policies, which it said had been approved in multiple Spanish and EU court hearings.
Its rival EastJet, Spanish airlines Volotea and Vueling, and Norwegian Air were also fined for charging passengers to reserve adjacent seats for children and other dependents.
Spain’s consumer rights ministry said the penalties had also been applied for not accepting cash when selling tickets at airports.
Ryanair, which was the first to start charging extra for hand luggage in November 2018, was slapped with the biggest fine of €107.8m (£89.7m).
EasyJet was fined €29.1m (£24.2m).

Banks slump amid rising rate cut bets
UK bank stocks have slumped after Britain’s private sector activity shrank for the first time in a year following the Budget.
Banks were down 1.6pc across the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 as the weak economic data increased bets on interest rate cuts.
Barclays was down 3.5pc, Standard Chartered fell 2.8pc, NatWest dropped 2.3pc and Lloyds Banking Group fell 1.9pc.
HSBC was down 0.9pc as money markets indicate the Bank of England will cut interest rates at least three times next year, sending the pound to its lowest level since May.
11:08 AM GMT
February interest rate cut ‘slam dunk’ as activity shrinks
The contraction in Britain’s private sector economy makes an interest rate cut in February a “slam dunk” according to economists.
Money markets indicate there is a 89pc chance that the Bank of England will reduce borrowing costs at its first meeting next year, up from a litter under 80pc on Thursday, after business activity slumped for the first time in a year following the Budget.
Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “In isolation, the sharp drop in the headline index of the flash composite PMI for November would substantially raise the probability of the MPC cutting interest rates in December.
“But the PMI captures only part of the story. The tax hikes hitting private sector sentiment will be recycled by Chancellor Reeves into stronger government spending which is mostly not measured by the PMI, although government investment plans should support the construction PMI more elevated.
“What’s more, sticky price pressures signalled by the PMI, signs that the headline survey balance may have overshot in November, now rising CPI inflation, and the risks from election of Mr Trump in the US leaves only a low chance of another rate cut in December.
“Signs of weaker growth, however, make a February rate cut a slam dunk we think.
“Accordingly, the market repriced closer to our call after the PMI release, now pricing three rate cuts over the next 12 months. We expect the same, with the MPC cutting in February, May and November.”
10:38 AM GMT
Pound drops after private sector activity shrinks
The value of the pound has dropped sharply after a closely watched survey showed Britain’s private sector activity shrank for the first time in more than a year after the Budget.
Sterling was down as much as 0.9pc against the dollar to less than $1.25 - its lowest level since May - after preliminary PMI data showed business output declined in November.
It was the first contraction in activity since October last year and comes after Rachel Reeves raised taxes by £40bn in the Budget, including a £25bn increase in employer National Insurance contributions.
The pound was also down 0.1pc against the euro, which is worth 83.3p.
Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist Sanjay Raja said: “Today’s PMI data were the first real test of the Chancellor’s Budget – alongside businesses reaction to unfolding geopolitical events.
“Underneath the hood, we are seeing stress on hiring plans. Both the manufacturing and services sectors reported falls in hiring plans. And (input) prices – particularly for services – have started to firm – as businesses digest the Budget tax implications.
“For policymakers, the key question now will be to assess whether the potential inflationary hit from higher taxes offsets the potential demand hit from weaker private demand. With prices likely to pick up in the first half of 2025, we expect the [Bank of England] to be more cautious than ever, treading a fine line between removing policy restraint too quickly, or indeed, keeping policy too restrictive in the face of heightened uncertainty.”

More job losses to come following Budget tax raid, say economists
Bosses are growing more concerned about having to make job cuts after a downturn in output since the Budget, economists have said.
The closely watched S&P Global Flash UK PMI said both Britain’s manufacturing and service sectors reduced their headcounts in November.
It said private sector firms had widely commented about hiring freezes and avoiding replacing voluntary leavers.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said “the downturns in output and hiring represent marked contrasts to the robust growth rates seen back in the summer and are accompanied by deepening concern about prospects for the year ahead”.
He said: “The November PMI is indicative of the economy slipping into a modest decline, with GDP dropping at a 0.1pc quarterly rate, but the loss of confidence hints at worse to come – including further job losses – unless sentiment revives.”
Elias Hilmer, assistant economist at Capital Economics, added: “The fall in the Composite PMI suggests that tax hikes announced in the Budget seem to have restrained some private sector activity. Equally so, the prospect of new tariffs imposed by the incoming Trump administration may have weighed on activity too.”
10:01 AM GMT
Bosses cut back on staff as optimism drops
Britain’s private sector unexpectedly slumped as bosses began to cut back on staff and gave a “thumbs down” to the Budget, PMI data showed.
The contraction in output to 49.9 was lower than the expectations of economists, who had pencilled in a reading of 51.8 for the latest S&P Global survey.
Concerns about the business outlook, as well as stronger input price inflation, “impacted negatively on workforce numbers in November”, the preliminary PMI data indicated.
It said: “Survey respondents typically commented on subdued customer demand.
“Some firms noted delayed investment decisions, as well as cutbacks to new projects in response to worsening domestic business conditions and geopolitical uncertainty.”
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: “Business optimism has slumped sharply since the General Election, dropping further in November to hit the lowest since late 2022.
“Companies are giving a clear ‘thumbs down’ to the policies announced in the Budget, especially the planned increase in employers’ National Insurance contributions.”

Private sector shrinks after Reeves’s tax-raising Budget
Britain’s private sector suffered a slump in output for the first time in a year after Rachel Reeves’s tax-raising Budget, according to a closely watched survey.
The S&P Global Flash UK PMI - a gauge of activity in the UK economy - has fallen to 49.9 in November.
It is the first time the PMI reading has dropped below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction since October last year, and is the first major reading of Britain’s economic growth covering the period after the Budget, when taxes were increased by £40bn.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: “The first survey on the health of the economy after the Budget makes for gloomy reading.
“Businesses have reported falling output for the first time in just over a year while employment has now been cut for two consecutive months.
“Although only marginal, the downturns in output and hiring represent marked contrasts to the robust growth rates seen back in the summer and are accompanied by deepening concern about prospects for the year ahead.”

Eurozone private sector slumps amid ‘political mess’
Business activity in the eurozone contracted for the second time in three months in November, as weak demand saw companies facing challenges securing orders, a closely watched survey showed.
The HCOB Flash Eurozone purchasing managers’ index (PMI) published by S&P Global registered a figure of 48.1 compared to 50.0 in October. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below 50 shows contraction.
Dr Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: “Things could hardly have turned out much worse.
“The eurozone’s manufacturing sector is sinking deeper into recession, and now the services sector is starting to struggle after two months of marginal growth.
“It is no surprise really, given the political mess in the biggest eurozone economies lately – France’s government is on shaky ground, and Germany’s heading for early elections.
“Throw in the election of Donald Trump as US president, and it is no wonder the economy is facing challenges. Businesses are just navigating by sight.”

Electric car battery maker files for bankruptcy
The boss of electric car battery maker Northvolt has quit hours after the company filed for bankruptcy.
The beleaguered Swedish renewable energy company said chief executive Peter Carlsson will “step aside” but remain a member of the board of directors.
Northvolt said the search is underway for a successor to Mr Carlsson, who has led the company since its inception in 2016.
Overnight, the company filed for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while it reorganises its business.
Mr Carlsson said: “The Chapter 11 filing allows a period during which the company can be reorganised, ramp up operations while honouring customer and supplier commitments, and ultimately position itself for the long-term.”

Half-term timing held back retail sales, say economists
The timing of half-term hit retail sales last month, said economists who expect a rebound in the run-up to Christmas.
Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, acknowledged that the retail sector got off to a “shaky start” in the fourth quarter but said the second faces a “possible boost to seasonally adjusted sales in November if the timing of the school half term held back sales in October”.
He added a “rebound in consumer confidence in November and growing real incomes in Q4 all bode well for the golden quarter”.
He said: “And despite the tax rises announced in the Budget, we still expect the retail sector to support above-consensus consumption growth of 0.8pc in 2024, 1.3pc in 2025 and 1.8pc in 2026.”
Other economists also pointed to a rising trend in retail sales:

Government must reconsider taxes timeline, say retailers
As retail sales fell by more than expected last month, the British Retail Consortium’s director of insight Kris Hamer said:
While October produced a positive start to the ‘golden quarter’, with year-on-year growth for the fourth month in a row, there was a monthly decline due to pre-Budget jitters from households.
Fashion took the brunt of this hit, especially as the milder weather last month put off winter purchases.
Meanwhile, electricals performed well as people continued to upgrade their tech with the latest models. Health and beauty had yet another strong month of sales growth, especially with the popularity of beauty advent calendars which went on sale.
This additional revenue is essential as retailers face over £7bn of additional costs in 2025 alone, as changes to employers’ National Insurance contributions, the increase in minimum wage, and new packaging taxes come into effect.
“These changes will pile pressure onto an industry that already pays far more than its fair share in business taxes, and will make job losses and store closures inevitable.
“To avoid a cliff edge of costs in April 2025, Government must reconsider the existing timelines for the new packaging levy, while ensuring any changes to business rates offer a meaningful reduction for all retailers as early as possible.”

Mild weather hits clothing sales at start of ‘Golden Quarter’
Clothing stores had a particularly weak month, with industry data suggesting that mild October weather may have caused shoppers to hold off buying more warm winter clothing.
Jacqui Baker, head of retail at RSM UK, said it was a “concerning start to the Golden Quarter” in the run-up to Christmas when retailers typically make most of their annual sales.
She said: “With half-term falling later this year and relatively mild weather, consumers have put off buying their winter coats and boots.
“This has made it difficult for retailers to shift stock, particularly as many have held off spending to take advantage of Black Friday deals.”
Asif Aziz, retail director at EE added: “October has been a quiet month on the high street with shoppers clearly keeping their powder dry ahead of Black Friday sales.
“Uncertainty around the Budget will have also fostered a save now, spend tomorrow mindset, as consumers start to factor in increased expenditure in the run-up to Christmas.”

Budget blamed as retail sales slump
Retail sales slumped last month, official figures show, as shoppers held back spending ahead of Rachel Reeves’s Budget.
Sales volumes fell 0.7pc in October compared to the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The figure was down from a rise of 0.1pc in September, which was revised down from a previous estimate of 0.3pc growth.
It was also worse than analyst estimates for a fall of 0.3pc.
ONS senior statistician Hannah Finselbach said: “The fall was driven by a notably poor month for clothing stores, but retailers across the board reported consumers held back on spending ahead of the Budget.”
It comes after dozens of Britain’s biggest retailers this week warned the Chancellor that her plans to hike National Insurance will cause staff to be laid off and shops to be shut.
Major companies including Tesco, M&S, Boots and B&Q wrote to Ms Reeves saying that job losses were now “inevitable”, as a result of the “sheer scale” of the new costs on business.
In a letter from over 70 companies, Ms Reeves was told that the sector faces £7bn in increased costs as a result of changes to employers’ National Insurance, a higher minimum wage rise and levies on packaging.

How Can You Earn $100 Per Month As An Apple Investor?
If you want to make $100 per month –$1,200 annually – from Apple dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $272,727, which is 1,191 shares at $229 each.
Understanding the dividend yield calculations: When estimating, you need two key variables – the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (0.44% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.0044 = $272,727 to generate an income of $100 per month.
You can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price.
Story Continues
The dividend yield can change over time due to fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.
For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).
In summary, income-focused investors may find Apple stock an attractive option for making a steady income of $100 per month by owning 1,191 shares of stock.

20241122,AAPL,"LONDON (AP) — Apple and Google aren't giving consumers a genuine choice of mobile web browsers, a British watchdog said Friday in a report that recommends they face an investigation under new U.K. digital rules taking effect next year.
The Competition and Markets Authority took aim at Apple, saying the iPhone maker's tactics hold back innovation by stopping rivals from giving users new features like faster webpage loading. Apple does this by restricting progressive web apps, which don't need to be downloaded from an app store and aren't subject to app store commissions, the report said.
“This technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,” the watchdog said in a provisional report on its investigation into mobile browsers that it opened after an initial study concluded that Apple and Google effectively have a chokehold on “mobile ecosystems.”
The CMA's report also found that Apple and Google manipulate the choices given to mobile phone users to make their own browsers “the clearest or easiest option.”
And it said that the a revenue-sharing deal between the two U.S. Big Tech companies “significantly reduces their financial incentives” to compete in mobile browsers on Apple's iOS operating system for iPhones.
Both companies said they will “engage constructively” with the CMA.
Apple said it disagreed with the findings and said it was concerned that the recommendations would undermine user privacy and security.
Google said the openness of its Android mobile operating system “has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratize access to smartphones and apps"" and that it's “committed to open platforms that empower consumers.”
It's the latest move by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to crack down on the dominance of Big Tech companies. U.S. federal prosecutors this week unveiled their proposals to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser as they target its monopoly in online search.
The CMA's final report is due by March. The watchdog indicated it would recommend using the U.K.'s new digital competition rulebook set to take effect next year, which includes new powers to rein in tech companies, to prioritize further investigation into Apple’s and Google’s “activities in mobile ecosystems.""

20241122,AAPL,"The mobile browser market in the UK is not working well for businesses and consumers and Apple and Google should be investigated further by the competition watchdog, an initial inquiry has said.
The Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) independent inquiry group carried out an in-depth assessment of the mobile browser markets, and has raised concerns about how Apple controls how mobile web browsers work on its devices.
The CMA opened its investigation after its own market study, published in 2021, found Apple and Google have an effective duopoly on mobile ecosystems, across operating systems, app stores and web browsers on mobile devices, which it said meant the two companies were in a position to effectively set the rules on how mobile browsers work on their respective devices.
The independent inquiry group’s initial inquiry found that Apple’s rules in this area restrict competitors from being able to deliver new and innovative features to consumers.
It said concerns had been raised by other browser providers, who said that they are unable to offer a full range of features because of how Apple’s iOS and App Store operate.
In addition, it said Apple and Google can manipulate how users are presented with choices about which web browser to use on their devices to make their own browsers the clearest or easiest option.
As a result, the group has recommended that the CMA prioritises investigating Apple and Google’s activities in mobile ecosystems under new digital markets competition rules coming into force next year.
Margot Daly, chairwoman of the CMA’s independent inquiry group, said: “Markets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers.
“Through our investigation, we have provisionally found that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK.
“The analysis set out in this report and a range of potential interventions considered to address the market issues identified by the group merits consideration by the CMA board under its new powers, which have been specifically designed for digital markets.
“Under those new powers, the CMA can consider the case for designating firms with strategic market status, taking account of the interplay between the specific markets that are the subject of this market investigation and Apple’s and Google’s wider mobile ecosystems.”
Elsewhere, the group had also looked at the mobile cloud gaming market in the UK, but found that there was no need for the CMA to intervene at this time.

In response, Apple said: “Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.
“We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS.
“We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart.

Mobile browser markets aren’t working well for businesses and millions of phone users in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority said in a statement on Friday. The agency recommended investigating the two companies’ activities under tougher digital markets competition rules, which will come into force next year.
Apple and Google can manipulate consumer choices to make their own browsers Safari and Chrome, “the clearest or easiest option,” the UK regulator said in a statement on its interim findings.
Most concerns centered on Apple’s mobile browser, which it said “is holding back innovation in the browsers we use to access the web on mobile phones.” A revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple also significantly reduces financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on the Apple devices, the regulator said.
“Apple and Google earn significant revenue when their key rival’s mobile browser is used on iOS, reducing their financial incentives to compete,” the watchdog added. “In fact, the extent of this revenue-sharing is so large that the revenue share they earn from their competitor’s product is lower but similarly significant to the revenue share they earn from their own, so that the incremental revenue from winning customers, and therefore the financial incentive to compete, is limited.”
The CMA’s move is among a series of high-profile investigations as regulators across the planet seek to break tech monopolies and anti-competitive practices. Apple and Google are under intense scrutiny in the European Union, under the bloc’s new digital antitrust rulebook, the Digital Markets Act.
Chrome Sale
Apple is facing a potential fine over its App Store rules, while Google is under pressure to re-engineer its search services to step into line with the rules. The US Department of Justice recently proposed to sell Alphabet’s Chrome.
Apple disagreed with the findings, it said in a statement. The interventions “would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart,” it said.
Story Continues
“Android’s openness has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratize access to smartphones and apps,” Google’s spokesperson said. Google will remain committed to open platforms and help developers build successful businesses, the company said.
The new rules on digital markets will give the CMA the power to label companies as having Strategic Market Status. The agency must undertake a formal investigation to designate a firm, it said.
The probe started in 2022 after a separate study concluded the duo have a “vice-like grip” over operating systems, app stores and web browsers on mobile devices.
The watchdog will drop the investigation into cloud gaming on mobile as Apple has made changes during the investigation to allow cloud gaming apps to be sold on its App Store.

“2023 was really a year of industry and businesses wrapping their heads around AI. 2024 is the year we’re starting to see real-scale deployments of our technology”.
Countless innovations in AI prove how the technology continues to be a strong force today. In the latest news, Enfabrica, a California-based startup that aims to make AI chips work more efficiently together at scale, recently announced that it has raised $115 million in funding and plans to release its newest chip early next year.
The startup is tackling one of the biggest technical problems that has emerged in the AI field. The problem is related to tying tens of thousands (or more) of chips together with a network.  The chip company strives to allow computing chips to simultaneously talk to more parts of a network.
According to co-founder and CEO Rochan Sankar, current systems can link about 100,000 AI chips before the network slows down. Sankar says chips from Enfabrica could increase this figure to about 500,000 chips, making it possible to train even larger AI models.
“It’s become apparent in the last six to nine months that the attributes of that network really drive the capability of that (computing power), whether it’s bandwidth, resiliency or recovery from loss. All these things matter when you start running at scale.”
In other news, OpenAI has recently launched a free training course for teachers with non-profit partner Common Sense Media. The training will enable teachers to understand artificial intelligence and use it efficiently. The move comes amid OpenAI promoting a positive image of ChatGPT in education. Previously, ChatGPT had been causing a frenzy as it helped students spin-off papers, complete their homework, and even write novels.

20241122,AAPL,"LONDON (Reuters) -Apple could be holding back innovation in smartphone browsers, according to a British regulatory report, which recommended that Apple's and Google's duopoly in mobile ecosystems should be investigated with its new powers.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Friday its inquiry group had provisionally found that the mobile browser market was not working well for UK businesses and millions of phone users.
The group's biggest concerns related to Apple's policies on accessing the web on iPhones. It provisionally found Apple's rules restricted competitors from being able to deliver new features that could benefit consumers.
It said many smaller British app developers wanted to use progressive web apps – an alternative way to provide apps to users without downloading them through an app store – but the technology was not able to fully take off on Apple's devices.
A revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple had also reduced their incentives to compete in mobile browsers on Apple devices, it found.
The CMA's Digital Markets Unit, set up more than three years ago, has gained new powers to tackle the power of big tech companies with interventions in the market. The new regime is expected to come into force in January.
Apple said it disagreed with the CMA group's findings on its Safari browser and in-app browsing on its iOS operating system

Per the firm, the kit is the quickest way for full-stack developers to build web apps with AI capabilities such as chat, conversational search, and summarization. The kit will allow developers to easily leverage their data to get customized responses from Amazon Bedrock AI models.

20241122,AMZN,"The artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to expand, with major players making significant moves.
Nvidia (NVDA) maintains its leadership position by exceeding third quarter estimates earlier this week while Amazon (AMZN) deepened its AI commitment with an additional $4 billion investment in Anthropic, designating the startup as Amazon Web Services' primary service provider.
""We really are at the building stage of AI,"" Epistrophy Capital Research chief market strategist Cory Johnson tells Morning Brief, calling it ""a real life-changing thing.""
Johnson notes that the Amazon-Anthropic partnership is ""interesting... from a semiconductor perspective."" He explains that with Anthropic agreeing to help develop Amazon's ""Trainium"" chips, Amazon has effectively ""bought themselves a customer"" for when the chips are completed.
However, Johnson raises concerns about Nvidia's market position: ""I'm really curious about what the partners of Nvidia are going to say to Nvidia three years from now. 'Hey, remember when you took your gross margins from 46% to 79%, and you made us pay all that when we couldn't go anywhere else?' I mean [I] wonder if that's going to create bad feelings among customers.""

20241122,AMZN,"Nvidia’s NVDA quarterly results were excellent, with the chip giant not only beating estimates and raising guidance but also achieving top- and bottom-line growth rates that are typically associated with start-up players.
Nvidia’s Q3 earnings increased +106.3% from the year-earlier period to $19.37 billion while revenues were up +93.6% year-over-year to +35.08 billion.
To get a sense of the market’s lukewarm reaction to these otherwise impressive results from Nvidia, take a look at the chart below that plots the stock price relative to how estimates consensus EPS estimates have evolved over time.

The chart's light blue and red lines represent the evolution of consensus EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025, respectively. The steepness of those lines shows how persistent the favorable revisions trend has been, with analysts seemingly struggling to catch up with how strong underlying business trends have been for Nvidia.
Nvidia’s stock market momentum has made its market capitalization the highest of the Magnificent 7 group at $3.59 trillion, surpassing Apple at $3.45 trillion and Microsoft at $3.07 trillion. Investors’ lukewarm reaction suggests that they have become used to getting far bigger guidance upgrades than what they received this time around. Nvidia’s upgraded guidance is solid, but relatively underwhelming by the company’s own standards.
We don’t want to come across as making too big of a deal of the stock’s reaction to the quarterly results. After all, Nvidia shares are up +191.3% over the past year and have handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (up +32.5%), the S&P 500 index (up +30.4%), and the Mag 7 group (up +20.6%).

Beyond Nvidia, the focus lately has been on the Retail sector, with several major conventional operators coming out with quarterly results. Through Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 29 of the 34 Retail sector companies in the S&P 500 index.
Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.
The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players.
Total Q3 earnings for these 29 retailers that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 58.6% beating EPS estimates and only 51.7% beating revenue estimates.

The comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.

As you can see above, members of the Zacks Retail sector have struggled to beat estimates in Q3, with the trend particularly notable on the EPS beats front that are tracking below the 20-quarter low at this stage.
Concerning the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 24 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q3 earnings were up +71.6% on +11% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.
As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is now a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.
The two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).

Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard
Through Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 476 S&P 500 members, or 92.2% of the index’s total membership. We have another 8 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this holiday-shortened week, including Dell, HP, Best Buy, and others.
Total earnings for these 476 companies that have reported are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 73.7% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates.
The proportion of these 476 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51.1%.
The comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. The first set of comparison charts show the earnings and revenue growth rates.

One significant drag on the aggregate growth pace has been the Energy sector, whose Q3 earnings were down -22.9% from the same period last year on -2.7% lower revenues. Q3 earnings for the index would be up +10.6% on +6.3% higher revenues had it not been for this Energy sector drag.

As you can see above, the growth trend appears stable-to-positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter averages.
The Earnings Big Picture
Looking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues.
The chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.
Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.
Had it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +10.6% instead of +8.1%. Excluding the Tech sector’s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be up only +2.9% instead of +8.1%.
Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +2.4% instead of +8.1%.
For the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues.
Unlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better, as the chart below shows.

20241122,AMZN,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is investing an additional $4 billion in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, boosting its stake in one of OpenAI’s chief rivals.

The new infusion, announced by the companies on Friday, follows a $4 billion investment in Anthropic completed earlier this year. That deal included provisions that Anthropic use Amazon Web Services data centers for some of its computing needs, as well as AWS-designed AI chips. Anthropic also has close ties with Alphabet Inc.’s Google.
The latest investment “establishes AWS as our primary cloud and training partner,” Anthropic said in a blog post, adding that the startup plans to use Amazon’s AI chips to develop its most advanced models. The deal maintains Amazon’s minority stake in the company, Anthropic said. As with Amazon’s original $4 billion infusion, this deal takes the form of convertible notes. Amazon’s initial additional investment will be $1.3 billion, with the rest to follow.
Founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, Anthropic has become one of the ChatGPT maker’s closest rivals. Its Claude family of chatbots is widely seen as among the most capable of generating text from scratch. Anthropic has gained traction selling AI software to businesses, including finance and healthcare firms. And Amazon has used its close relationship with Anthropic to bolster its credentials in AI services, offering the Claude models to clients on the AWS marketplace of AI model providers.
The additional investment from Amazon highlights the enthusiasm for AI products and the immense capital needs for building the large language models that underpin them. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in funding in October at a $157 billion valuation. Elon Musk’s xAI, meanwhile, has been seeking to raise funding at a $40 billion valuation, Bloomberg previously reported.
Anthropic Chief Executive Officer Dario Amodei has said he expects the costs of developing larger AI models could eventually grow to $100 billion, up from $100 million this year. Like other leading AI developers, however, Anthropic has also seen some diminishing returns from its costly efforts to build more advanced artificial intelligence models, Bloomberg previously reported. Anthropic has seen the timetable slip for the release of its long-awaited Claude model called 3.5 Opus.
Story Continues
Anthropic and other AI companies have also seen their funding deals come under scrutiny from regulators who worry that big tech is using large investments and cloud computing partnerships to dominate the emerging AI sector.
The UK’s competition watchdog recently cleared the prior investments from Amazon and Google into Anthropic. But the US Justice Department is now seeking to unwind Google’s Anthropic deal in particular.
Amazon shares were little changed as the markets opened in New York on Friday.

20241122,AMZN,"We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks on the list.
With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least.
Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71,  the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence.
Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns.
As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade.
GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.”
Story Continues
Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.”
While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%.
Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.”

Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.”
Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.”
Our Methodology
To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

20241122,NFLX,"Netflix stock (NFLX) closed at a fresh record every day this past week, with shares securing their biggest weekly gain since January — and they could keep soaring.
A growing number of analysts are calling for the streaming giant's shares to soon trade in the quadruple digits.
On Wednesday, Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak raised his price target on Netflix to a Street high of $1,100 a share, implying over 20% upside based on current trading levels of around $900.
Bank of America's Jessica Reif Ehrlich followed one day later, boosting her target to $1,000 from $800. Jefferies analyst James Heaney also raised his target to $1,000 earlier this week.
The price target increases come despite some concerns over slowing growth for the streaming giant.

Wall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $800 a share, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.
One of the main catalysts for the recent price target boosts is the company's continued foray into live events, with the most recent boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson attracting over 108 million global viewers last weekend to become the most-streamed sporting event of all time.
For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers.
The Netflix event's impressive numbers came despite the streamer experiencing several technical glitches throughout the broadcast, which analysts (and investors) mostly shrugged off.
""We view the event as a (very) successful learning experience for NFLX and expect these technical issues will not happen again with future live events,"" Pivotal Research's Wlodarczak wrote on Wednesday.
The analyst said the event's success likely means Netflix will ""accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming,"" which will help lower subscriber churn and increase the streamer's ability to raise prices.
""The NFLX service remains a highly compelling, frankly relatively inexpensive, entertainment alternative for consumers, which bodes well for future subscriber/average revenue per user growth,"" he said.
Netflix's 'complementary growth drivers'

Since the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged roughly 85%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.
Story Continues
Last week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.
Netflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyoncé will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.
The company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Jefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a ""breakthrough"" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.
BofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, ""Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.""
Netflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.
Still, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.
""With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.
Valuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock ""is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025."" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Netflix shares were on track for a fifth consecutive gain on Friday and set for their biggest weekly percentage rise since January, after the streaming media company's popular boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul.
The stock was last up 0.2% at $899.06, off its intraday record high of $908 on Thursday. It has risen every session since the Nov. 15 fight, taking the stock up more than 9% for the week.
Several brokerages this week raised their price targets on the stock, including BofA Global Research, which on Thursday bumped up its price target to $1,000 from $800.
Netflix said on Tuesday that 108 million people worldwide watched the match between Paul, a 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prize-fighter, and the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Tyson. The event, which Paul won, was streamed live on Netflix.

20241122,NFLX,"Netflix Boxing Battle Decided In The Ring, But Paul's $16M Mansion Takes The Real Estate Crown
Jake Paul was victorious in Friday’s highly anticipated Netflix boxing match against Mike Tyson and his real estate portfolio seems to outshine the boxing legend’s holdings too.

The 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer won unanimously and bought a $16 million compound that dwarfs Tyson's Nevada residence.

Paul's recently acquired estate in Dorado, Puerto Rico, shows the social media star's success outside the ring. The eight-bedroom, eight-bathroom compound underwent $2.1 million in renovations after its 2023 purchase.

In a recent YouTube tour titled “My new $20,000,000 house tour,” Paul highlighted his changes, including a redesigned entrance for improved energy flow.
According to Realtor.com, the property includes several distinctive amenities, such as a 40-person hot tub and dedicated office space for Paul’s content production team. His garage also received a custom makeover to accommodate his growing car collection.
By comparison, Tyson's real estate footprint appears modest.

The former heavyweight champion's current residence, a $2.5 million mansion in Henderson, Nevada, has appreciated to an estimated $4.7 million, according to Realtor.com. The 8,000-square-foot home, where he lives with his wife, Lakiha Spicer and their children, has six bedrooms and six bathrooms.

According to the report, Tyson's real estate history includes a previous 19,500-square-foot estate in Southington, Ohio, which he sold for $1.3 million during financial difficulties in the late 1990s.

The 58-acre property's subsequent owner never occupied it, serving time in prison for money laundering.
The record-breaking boxing match, which earned Paul roughly $40 million and Tyson $20 million, further widens the wealth gap between the two fighters. According to CBS News, Paul said he wanted to fight again after the victory, targeting a championship title within two years. ""I truly believe in my skills, my ability and my power,"" he said, setting his sights on the cruiserweight division.

While Tyson acknowledged the loss gracefully, posting “This is one of those situations when you lost but still won” on X, formerly Twitter.

20241122,NFLX,"Think about the last time you listened to music on Spotify, watched a movie on Netflix, hailed a ride on Uber, or ordered food via DoorDash. These companies have millions of digital customers—and billions of interactions with them. They are using the insights from this data to rapidly optimize each customer’s next experience.
In the age of artificial intelligence, competitive advantage is increasingly determined by a company's ability to deliver personalized experiences at scale. We call this phenomenon the “personalization advantage,” which can be expressed by a simple formula:
P = n × v2
P represents the competitive advantage of personalization.
N is the volume of interactions from which the company can learn.
V is the speed of learning, which has an exponential impact.
The Personalization Advantage formula illustrates why these companies are winning: they have both scale (n) in terms of customer interactions and speed (v) in learning from and acting on these interactions.
Personalization is not just customization—it’s about using customer data to deliver experiences tailored in real-time, evolving with each interaction. Whether it's a website suggesting products you didn't know you needed based on prior behavior, a call center agent knowing your shopping history with the company, or a sales associate remembering your preferences, the key is scaling these interactions across millions of customers and constantly learning from them.
Personalization is creating experiences at scale that get fine-tuned with each successive interaction, empowering customers to get what they want better, faster, cheaper, or more easily. The difference lies in the way personalized communications build on everything the company learns about the customer over time, and about how other customers like them behave. In our experience across industries and consumer contexts, this is what makes personalization truly effective. This effectiveness is directly linked to the Personalization Advantage formula. The more interactions a company has (n), and the faster it can learn from them (v), the greater its personalization advantage (P) becomes.
It is enabled by the many different forms of AI available: machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and others, often combined together. Business is now effectively at the point where competitive advantage will be based on a company’s ability to relentlessly capture, analyze, and utilize customer data, at a massive scale, with every possible contact—and on how it uses that data to understand, shape, personalize, and optimize each customer’s journey.
Story Continues
Building economies of scale has always been important in business, especially in the physical aspects of competition: supply chains, production, and distribution. However, personalization changes the nature of scale in the customer experience from the mass production of goods to the mass delivery of 1:1 experiences built on accumulated intelligence. Personalization at scale, and the ongoing cycle of experimentation and learning that power it, create a competitive moat that is very hard to replicate. This competitive moat is precisely what our Personalization Advantage formula quantifies.
It’s about scale (n)
Companies such as Alipay, Amazon, Tencent, Flipkart, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify have each amassed over 200 million active users. The sheer size of their digital customer base is enormous. They distill insights about these users not just when they transact, but every time they browse or click in a digital channel. But even non-digital native companies are maximizing the “surface area” they have for gathering and using customer information—like an alarm company understanding how homeowners use their touchpads or B2B distributors tracking the frequency and nature of replenishment orders.
These companies even know the lifetime value of each new active user they add—and invest accordingly. For example, a large food and beverage company we’ve worked with estimated that each 10 million new digital customer relationships would add $1 billion in incremental revenue.
It’s about speed (v)
Ultimately, personalization is about what companies do with the insights about their customers. This is where companies are competing on speed. Speed in getting to know the customer throughout the customer journey, speed in executing based on a trigger about a customer, and speed in constantly improving the experience based on that knowledge. We are big believers in the importance of “time-based competition,” the concept of competing on the basis of speed. In personalization, it is foundational.
The squared term in our formula (v2) emphasizes the outsized impact of speed. Doubling the speed of learning and execution more than doubles the personalization advantage.
It is no coincidence that companies across a wide swath of categories, including home improvement, banking, restaurants, grocery, and apparel have publicly announced that personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences are central to their corporate strategy. These companies understand that maximizing both (n) and (v) in the Personalization Advantage formula is crucial for their success.
By studying hundreds of personalization leaders over the past decade, we have even quantified the size of the personalization advantage pioneering companies are capturing in terms of growth. Across industries, we find that personalization leaders consistently outgrow laggards. In fact, leaders grow top-line revenues 10 points faster per year than laggards. Taken together, we estimate that by the end of this decade, the personalization leaders, on a combined basis, will capture almost $2 trillion in incremental growth.
The basis of competition has shifted—and the prize for those that rethink their business model accordingly is enormous. But here’s the catch. Our research also finds that only 10% of companies qualify as personalization leaders. Many businesses say they are doing personalization but fail to go beyond basic segmented marketing. They end up sending more spam, generating more calls from complaining customers, and frustrating themselves with slower growth than expected. These laggards are failing to optimize both (n) and (v) in the personalization advantage formula, limiting their growth potential.

20241122,NFLX,"Netflix's NFLX transformation from a DVD rental service to a streaming giant is taking another significant leap with its ambitious push into live content. The company's recent successes with events like the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match, which drew 108 million average viewers, demonstrate its potential in the live streaming arena. However, technical challenges during these events raise questions about the platform's readiness for major live programming.
Technical Infrastructure Concerns
Netflix's strategic expansion into live streaming, marked by high-profile events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the $5 billion WWE deal, demonstrates its commitment to diversifying content offerings beyond traditional streaming. However, widespread streaming issues and buffering problems plagued many viewers. These technical difficulties are particularly concerning as the company prepares for even bigger events, including two NFL Christmas Day games and the upcoming launch of WWE's Monday Night Raw in 2025.

The platform's ability to handle large-scale concurrent streaming remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed. Despite these short-term hurdles, Netflix's strong market position, growing advertising business and comprehensive entertainment strategy suggest long-term potential. However, given the significant investments required and execution risks in live programming, investors might benefit from waiting for stronger evidence of successful implementation before increasing exposure.
Strategic Content Acquisitions
Netflix's $5 billion deal with WWE for Monday Night Raw represents a significant investment in live programming. Combined with NFL games and special events featuring major entertainers like Beyoncé, the company is positioning itself as a comprehensive entertainment destination. This diversification strategy could help Netflix maintain its competitive edge in an increasingly crowded streaming landscape.

Netflix expects paid net additions to be higher sequentially in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects substantial growth in paid subscribers, with total paid memberships expected to reach 290.54 million by the end of 2024, indicating an 11.6% year-over-year increase.
Financial Implications and Growth Prospects
The company expects revenues to grow in the range of 11-13% in 2025, reaching $43-$44 billion. This growth rate represents a slowdown from the 15% expected in 2024. Netflix's investment in live content and infrastructure improvements may pressure margins in the short term, though management targets a 28% operating margin for 2025.

With total debt reaching $15.98 billion and streaming content obligations at $22.7 billion, Netflix faces significant financial commitments.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $38.91 billion, indicating 15.37% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $19.78 per share, indicating a substantial 64.42% increase from the previous year.

The recent surge in Netflix's stock price has led to expanded valuation multiples, potentially limiting future upside for investors. The company's forward 12-month sales multiple of 8.73 exceeds its five-year median of 6.53, indicating that the stock may be trading at a premium to its historical valuation. Moreover, this multiple surpasses the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward earnings multiple of 3.4, suggesting that Netflix's valuation is stretched relative to its peers.

Market Position and Competition
As traditional media companies increasingly bundle their services, Netflix is taking a different approach by expanding its standalone offering. The addition of live sports and entertainment could help justify future price increases and reduce churn. However, the technical challenges and high costs associated with live programming present risks.

Investors have responded enthusiastically to Netflix's performance, with NFLX shares returning an impressive 81.5% year to date, significantly outperforming tech giants like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.

Investment Outlook
While Netflix's push into live streaming shows promise, current investors should maintain their positions but new investors might want to wait for a better entry point. The company needs to prove that it can consistently deliver high-quality live streaming experiences before the market fully prices in this growth opportunity. Additionally, the significant investments required for live content rights and technical infrastructure may impact near-term profitability.
Conclusion
Netflix's venture into live streaming represents both an opportunity and a challenge. While the strategy could strengthen its market position, technical hurdles and high costs suggest caution. Current shareholders should remain invested to benefit from the company's long-term potential, but new investors might find better entry points after Netflix demonstrates consistent execution in live programming delivery. Netflix currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241122,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX, Financial) is in trouble with the law over the much-hyped live stream of the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match, which is said to have been riddled with major issues. A Florida-based person named Ronald Blue Denton sued Netflix in state court for what he considered a shoddy performance in delivering the event to its clients in sharp craving, stating that Netflix was unstoppably ill-equipped for the demand for the show, making it unwatchable.
The lawsuit alleges that Netflix violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and breached the parties' contract while also demanding monetary damages and a class action on behalf of other affected Netflix subscribers. According to Denton, Netflix is guilty of abdicating its role as a service provider since it failed to provide a perfect viewing experience for millions of people.
The November 15 fight that Netflix promoted as its primary sports event attracted 108 million viewers worldwide. Nonetheless, many people used social networks to complain about the declining video quality, numerous instances of buffering, and completely frozen streams, especially if the moment in the match was important.
Netflix included the topic as part of a significant milestone in sports streaming to establish its dominance in the live segment. Denton's lawsuit now appears to potentially overshadow the feat and is symbolic of the dangers of mounting highly visible live events when viewer expectations steadily rise.
This legal dispute could try Netflix for various technical problems and issue a challenge to how the company plans to handle mass streaming events as it faces increasing competition in live sports rights. As of yet, the company has not said anything about this lawsuit.

20241122,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX, Financial) has broadcasted a record number of viewers. The live-stream matchboxing fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson has hit 108 million views and is the most streamed event on Netflix's sports platform. Scheduled for November 15 at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, the fight reached its highest number of concurrent viewers, or 65 million, 38 million of which were from the US.
Its Global AMA of 108 million, rating the event as one that records bests the figures of other main sporting broadcasts. The fight was Netflix's most-watched title of the week up through Sunday, with 46.6 million viewers. These numbers are derived from the TVision for US viewers and internal data for distinct viewers internationally.
Also, the co-main event with Amanda Serrano vs. Katie Taylor attracted 74 million live viewers from all over the world. The fight also attracted the highest AMA for a women's professional sports event in USA history, at 47 million.
No company is as dependent on third-party program suppliers as Netflix, but the service is seen in live sporting events as a way of reaching out to different customer bases, mainly in its scripted and documentary segments. This record-breaking viewership indicates that it is not only the initial days of the sports that can get a high television viewership. It also points towards the fact that the crossover boxing events are gaining popularity.
Appealing to entertainment with the help of such talents as Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, using the occasion of streaming, Netflix has identified itself as the major rival in the sphere of live sports streaming and broadcasting. The event marks growth in the platform's supremacy in the dissemination of various sporting activities across the globe.

20241122,NFLX,"Investors with an interest in Broadcast Radio and Television stocks have likely encountered both Fox Corporation (FOX) and Netflix (NFLX). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Fox Corporation and Netflix are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FOX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.
FOX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.71, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 44.06. We also note that FOX has a PEG ratio of 1.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.68.
Another notable valuation metric for FOX is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 16.39.
Based on these metrics and many more, FOX holds a Value grade of A, while NFLX has a Value grade of D.
FOX sticks out from NFLX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FOX is the better option right now.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Saturday that global collaboration and cooperation in technology will continue, even if the incoming U.S. administration imposes stricter export controls on advanced computing products.
President-elect Donald Trump, in his first term in office, imposed a series of restrictions on the sale of U.S. technology to China citing national security concerns - a policy broadly continued under incumbent President Joe Biden.
""Open science in global collaboration, cooperation across math and science has been around for a very long time. It is the foundation of social advancement and scientific advancement,"" Huang told media during a visit to Hong Kong.
Global cooperation is ""going to continue. I don't know what's going to happen in the new administration, but whatever happens, we'll balance simultaneously compliance with laws and policies, continue to advance our technology and support and serve customers all over the world.""
Earlier on Saturday Huang told graduates and academics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology that ""the age of AI has started"" in a speech after receiving an honorary doctorate degree in engineering.
The head of the world's leading maker of chips used for artificial intelligence applications received the award alongside actor Tony Leung, Nobel Prize for Chemistry winner Prof. Michael Levitt and Fields Medallist Prof. David Mumford.
""The age of AI has started. A new computing era that will impact every industry and every field of science,"" said Huang.
He said Nvidia has ""reinvented computing and sparked a new industrial revolution,"" 25 years after inventing the graphics processing unit.
""AI is certainly the most important technology of our time, and potentially of all times.""
Huang, 61, also told graduates that he wished he had started his career at this time.
""The whole world is reset. You're at the starting lines with everybody else. An industry is being reinvented. You now have the instruments, the instruments necessary to advance science in so many different fields,"" Huang said.
""The greatest challenges of our time, unimaginable challenges to overcome in the past, all of a sudden seem possible to tackle.""
In the afternoon, Huang will participate in a fireside chat with the university's Council Chairman Harry Sham, teachers and students.

20241122,NVDA,"Hindsight, they say, is 20/20. Looking back at past predictions, especially those made by prominent figures in the investment world, can offer valuable insights into market dynamics and the evolution of technology. In the case of NVIDIA (NVDA), a stock that has seen meteoric rise, revisiting past assessments can shed light on the challenges of predicting future market trends, even for seasoned investors.
On August 5th, several media outlets reported famous activist hedge fund Elliott Management's statements about AI hype and NVDA bubble. We summarized those statements in an article:
""Billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.
The $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarizing notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.
Paul Singer of Elliott Management
Elliott's letter was dated July 30th and predicted that the AI bubble will burst when NVDA "" has bad numbers and breaks the spell."". Here is an excerpt from that letter:
""Speaking of NVIDIA . . .

Interestingly NVDA shares hit a low of $92 on August 5th when the Elliott news came out. The stock returned more than 50% since that day, so the bubble must be 50% bigger now. NVDA posted a 17% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rate, so it doesn't look like the ""AI bubble"" is popping anytime soon. In the meantime, Elliott Associates returned 3.9% during the third quarter.
Our research director shared his views on NVDA’s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

For example, Crusoe Energy, a startup building data centers for large AI firms, plans to raise more than $800 million in funding, per regulatory filings. The filings detail that the company has already raised close to $685 million of the $818 million in total that it is seeking, with seventy investors contributing to the funding. Crusoe is one of many crypto-origin firms that have pivoted to AI in recent months.

A report by consulting firm McKinsey reveals that global demand for data center capacity could rise at an annual rate of between 19%-22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts. McKinsey analysis suggests that demand for AI-ready data center capacity will rise at an average rate of 33% a year between 2023 and 2030 in a midrange scenario. Per the consulting firm, this means that around 70% of total demand for data center capacity will be for data centers equipped to host advanced-AI workloads by 2030. Gen AI, currently the fastest-growing advanced-AI use case, will account for around 40 percent of the total, the report underlines.

Blue chips and small caps led Friday’s equities advance as this year’s big tech winners struggled to gain ground. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% while an equal-weighted version of the gauge — where Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. has the same influence as Nvidia Corp. — climbed 0.8%, on track for an all-time closing high.
Listen and follow The Big Take daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% while an index of bank stocks climbed to the highest in more than two years, the Russell 2000 jumped 1.8%. The small-cap index climbed 4.5% this week while the biggest technology stocks, like Nvidia, Alphabet Inc. and Facebook-parent company Meta Platforms Inc., lagged.
Fundstrat’s Thomas Lee sees room for more gains in small-caps and cyclicals given President-elect’s plans for deregulation and general “animal spirits.” He also sees a “Trump put” keeping the broader market buoyant. Faith that the government and Donald Trump won’t let the economy knuckle under is helping bolster stocks, at least for the moment.
“When sentiment reaches a ‘bullish extreme’ is when we see equities priced to ‘perfection,’” according to Lee. “By several measures, we are not there at that point yet.”
To Bank of America Corp. strategists the Nasdaq 100, which has rallied more than 4% this month, is approaching a level versus the S&P 500 that could trigger the unwinding of the trade favoring US equities. The tech-heavy gauge ended Friday up 0.2% with a 1.9% weekly gain.
Meanwhile, data on Friday showed S&P Global flash November composite output index for service providers and manufacturers advanced to 55.3 — the highest level since April 2022. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped around one basis point to 4.41%.
“The US flash PMIs for November were bullish in aggregate thanks to strength in services,” according to Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli, who said the details suggested a goldilocks scenario, “with favorable growth developments and cooling price pressures.”
Story Continues
The dollar registered its longest streak of weekly wins since September 2023. A Bloomberg gauge of the currency’s strength has risen around 2.6% so far this month, adding to October’s gains of nearly 3%.
“The US dollar’s run can continue,” said Peter McLean, head of multi-asset portfolio solutions at Stonehage Fleming. “We also have those geopolitical tensions, which are escalating at the moment. It’s natural for investors to seek refuge in the dollar.”
Bouts of volatility, driven by escalations in the war in Ukraine earlier in the week, eased Friday. The ongoing conflict helped to push WTI crude above $71 a barrel while gold traded at over $2,700 an ounce, and had its best week since March 2023.
The rally in Bitcoin set a fresh high Friday as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency races toward $100,000.
The latest developments included Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler’s decision to step down in January. His tenure was marked by a flurry of crypto enforcement actions, which the industry expects will peter out under Trump.
In Europe, S&P Global’s composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for the euro area dipped back beneath a level that indicates contraction in November. The region’s sovereign bonds rallied while the euro dropped to a two-year low.
Asian equities are on pace for their first back-to-back monthly losses this year amid dollar strength and lingering concerns over the Chinese economy. Still, the region’s more favorable valuations versus the US market are aiding recovery in some assets.
Elsewhere in Asia, Adani Group companies advanced after a $27 billion rout on Thursday following a US indictment against Gautam Adani over allegations of bribery. The company denied the allegations.

20241122,NVDA,"The artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to expand, with major players making significant moves.
Nvidia (NVDA) maintains its leadership position by exceeding third quarter estimates earlier this week while Amazon (AMZN) deepened its AI commitment with an additional $4 billion investment in Anthropic, designating the startup as Amazon Web Services' primary service provider.
""We really are at the building stage of AI,"" Epistrophy Capital Research chief market strategist Cory Johnson tells Morning Brief, calling it ""a real life-changing thing.""
Johnson notes that the Amazon-Anthropic partnership is ""interesting... from a semiconductor perspective."" He explains that with Anthropic agreeing to help develop Amazon's ""Trainium"" chips, Amazon has effectively ""bought themselves a customer"" for when the chips are completed.
However, Johnson raises concerns about Nvidia's market position: ""I'm really curious about what the partners of Nvidia are going to say to Nvidia three years from now. 'Hey, remember when you took your gross margins from 46% to 79%, and you made us pay all that when we couldn't go anywhere else?' I mean [I] wonder if that's going to create bad feelings among customers.""

20241122,NVDA,"Nvidia’s NVDA quarterly results were excellent, with the chip giant not only beating estimates and raising guidance but also achieving top- and bottom-line growth rates that are typically associated with start-up players.
Nvidia’s Q3 earnings increased +106.3% from the year-earlier period to $19.37 billion while revenues were up +93.6% year-over-year to +35.08 billion.
To get a sense of the market’s lukewarm reaction to these otherwise impressive results from Nvidia, take a look at the chart below that plots the stock price relative to how estimates consensus EPS estimates have evolved over time.
Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The chart's light blue and red lines represent the evolution of consensus EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025, respectively. The steepness of those lines shows how persistent the favorable revisions trend has been, with analysts seemingly struggling to catch up with how strong underlying business trends have been for Nvidia.
Nvidia’s stock market momentum has made its market capitalization the highest of the Magnificent 7 group at $3.59 trillion, surpassing Apple at $3.45 trillion and Microsoft at $3.07 trillion. Investors’ lukewarm reaction suggests that they have become used to getting far bigger guidance upgrades than what they received this time around. Nvidia’s upgraded guidance is solid, but relatively underwhelming by the company’s own standards.
We don’t want to come across as making too big of a deal of the stock’s reaction to the quarterly results. After all, Nvidia shares are up +191.3% over the past year and have handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (up +32.5%), the S&P 500 index (up +30.4%), and the Mag 7 group (up +20.6%).

Beyond Nvidia, the focus lately has been on the Retail sector, with several major conventional operators coming out with quarterly results. Through Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 29 of the 34 Retail sector companies in the S&P 500 index.
Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.
The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players.
Total Q3 earnings for these 29 retailers that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 58.6% beating EPS estimates and only 51.7% beating revenue estimates.
Story Continues
The comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.

As you can see above, members of the Zacks Retail sector have struggled to beat estimates in Q3, with the trend particularly notable on the EPS beats front that are tracking below the 20-quarter low at this stage.
Concerning the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 24 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q3 earnings were up +71.6% on +11% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.
As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is now a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.
The two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).

Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard
Through Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 476 S&P 500 members, or 92.2% of the index’s total membership. We have another 8 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this holiday-shortened week, including Dell, HP, Best Buy, and others.
Total earnings for these 476 companies that have reported are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 73.7% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates.
The proportion of these 476 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51.1%.
The comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. The first set of comparison charts show the earnings and revenue growth rates.

One significant drag on the aggregate growth pace has been the Energy sector, whose Q3 earnings were down -22.9% from the same period last year on -2.7% lower revenues. Q3 earnings for the index would be up +10.6% on +6.3% higher revenues had it not been for this Energy sector drag.

As you can see above, the growth trend appears stable-to-positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter averages.
The Earnings Big Picture
Looking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues.
The chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three quarters.
Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.
Had it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +10.6% instead of +8.1%. Excluding the Tech sector’s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be up only +2.9% instead of +8.1%.
Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +2.4% instead of +8.1%.
For the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues.
Unlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better, as the chart below shows.

20241122,NVDA,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has delivered better-than-expected sales and earnings in its latest quarterly report as it continues to progress banking on the incessant demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.
Amid the recent data center success, NVIDIA stock remains attractively priced, exhibits a bullish trend, and is fundamentally strong, making it a good buy for investors. Let’s see in detail –
NVIDIA Stock – Positive Q3 Data Center Result & Outlook
NVIDIA recently reported fiscal third-quarter results, in which its revenues jumped 94% to $35.1 billion from the same period a year ago. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.81, up 103% from a year ago.
The company’s revenues exceeded Wall Street expectations due to record gains from the data center business. Third-quarter revenues from the data center came in at $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago.
CEO Jensen Huang admitted that demand for its Superchips and related hardware was robust, particularly for its present Hopper chips. Huang expects continued high demand for Hopper chips into next year.
The advanced H200 chips will be available in several cloud services, such as Azure, Google Cloud and AWS. Beyond big tech cloud operators, Denmark launched its AI supercomputer driven by H100 Tensor Core graphic processing units (GPUs). The government’s demand for Hopper chips, beyond private companies, fuels NVIDIA’s growing data center business in the information arms race.
But it’s not all about Hopper chips, Huang clarified that the demand for the much-awaited next-generation Blackwell chips remains “staggering” for the fourth quarter and next year.
Companies like Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Meta Platforms, Inc. META will likely adopt the Blackwell chips for higher AI throughput than the current Hopper chips. The Blackwell platform can enhance AI training performance and train large language models cost-effectively.
According to SoftBank Corp, NVIDIA’s Blackwell platform will build Japan’s most powerful AI supercomputer. Also, NVIDIA’s Blackwell platform may power Taiwan’s fastest AI supercomputer. Therefore, the data center business will drive NVIDIA’s success and increase its share price, making it an enticing buy.
NVIDIA Stock is Less Pricey Than Its Peers
NVIDIA’s strong third-quarter performance comes as no surprise since the company has been delivering promising quarterly results for quite some time. NVIDIA is one of the top performers on the S&P 500 and is the most valuable company.
Despite all the success, buying NVIDIA stock as of now will burn a smaller hole in your pocket than its peers. After all, per the price/earnings, the NVDA stock trades at 51.7X forward earnings, less than the Semiconductor - General industry’s 59.6X forward earnings multiple.

NVIDIA Stock Has Bullish Chart Patterns
Despite NVIDIA’s commendable third-quarter performance, its share price dipped initially as the hype surrounding its earnings results was insane. The stock was in overbought territory and a short-term dip after the earnings release was inevitable.
However, the NVIDIA stock is currently trading above the short-term 50-day moving average (DMA) and long-term 200-DMA, a tell-tale bullish trend, making it a sound investment option.
Zacks Investment Research

NVIDIA Stock is Fundamentally Solid
NVIDIA has been able to manage its costs efficiently and generate profits persistently for a somewhat long time, which anyhow makes it the best stock to invest in.
NVIDIA’s net profit margin is 55%, higher than the industry’s 47.3%. Any reading greater than 20% indicates a high profit margin.

Similarly, NVIDIA’s return on equity (ROE) of 120.4% exceeded the industry average of 78.3%, showcasing that the net income surpassed equity.

Technology giants in the United States have pledged tens of billions towards building AI data centers in the next few years. These announcements have served to bolster the hype around companies that build data centers. For example, Crusoe Energy, a startup building data centers for large AI firms, plans to raise more than $800 million in funding, per regulatory filings. The filings detail that the company has already raised close to $685 million of the $818 million in total that it is seeking, with seventy investors contributing to the funding. Crusoe is one of many crypto-origin firms that have pivoted to AI in recent months.

A report by consulting firm McKinsey reveals that global demand for data center capacity could rise at an annual rate of between 19%-22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts. McKinsey analysis suggests that demand for AI-ready data center capacity will rise at an average rate of 33% a year between 2023 and 2030 in a midrange scenario. Per the consulting firm, this means that around 70% of total demand for data center capacity will be for data centers equipped to host advanced-AI workloads by 2030. Gen AI, currently the fastest-growing advanced-AI use case, will account for around 40 percent of the total, the report underlines.

He observed that even if the Biden government is improving cybersecurity defenses, further actions are required to deter nation-state intrusions.
According to Microsoft's own statistics, its users go through approximately 600 million cyberattacks per day, including state-sponsored entities working on operations and resource sharing alongside criminal organizations.
Talking on how a Trump presidency may affect the IT industry, Smith said it is too early to say any major impact will result. Any relaxation of U.S. merger and acquisition rules should be evaluated in relation to world norms, he said.
Following recent export restrictions on artificial intelligence chips imposed by the Biden government, Smith also advised the United States to help the transfer of American digital technology to areas such the Middle East and Africa. He underlined the need of developing consistent procedures to let American technology compete internationally.

20241122,MSFT,"Microsoft (MSFT) is preparing to roll out its long-delayed artificial intelligence-powered Recall feature for Windows 11 PCs to developers as part of its Windows Insider program.
The company initially announced Recall back in May when it debuted its Copilot+ PCs, AI PCs that have a specific set of features for running native AI applications. Recall is designed to capture screenshots of the various tasks you perform while using your computer, whether that’s browsing the web or working on a document.
The idea is for you to be able to search through Recall’s screenshots and then be able to take action on them. Say you were searching for flights and hotels for an upcoming trip or doing research for a work project but closed out your browser. You’d be able to search Recall for information related to those topics and pull up the appropriate screenshots.
With Microsoft’s Click to Do feature, which is also in preview, you’d then be able to take action on those screenshots. For instance, you’d be able to copy text, navigate back to the website Recall captured, or edit images.
It sounds very convenient for keeping track of your activity and going back to tasks you need to finish, but Recall immediately set off alarm bells among security researchers and privacy experts. The fear is that hackers or other cyber criminals could gain access to Recall’s screenshots and get their hands on sensitive user data.
Microsoft subsequently made a series of changes to Recall including making it an opt-in feature, rather than an opt-out feature, meaning users have to choose to use it instead of it automatically being available.
Microsoft's new Click to Do option provides you with a context sensitive toolbox for taking actions related to what you're viewing on your screen. (Image: Microsoft) · Microsoft
The company also said Recall screenshots, or Snapshots as Microsoft calls them, are encrypted and can only be accessed using the company’s Windows Hello authentication feature. You can also choose whether or not Recall saves information from specific websites. The app will also recognize when you’re entering sensitive information like credit card numbers, passwords, and other personal identification numbers and temporarily stop saving screenshots.
Microsoft also says you’ll be able to disable Recall through the Windows settings menu and that the feature is automatically removed from PCs that are managed by administrators for work and school.
The Recall preview will initially only be available for Windows 11 laptops running Qualcomm’s (QCOM) Snapdragon processors. Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) laptops will have to wait.
All of this is part of Microsoft’s effort to get users to buy into its Copilot+ PC effort. The general idea for the platform is to bring generative AI capabilities to Windows PCs through both on-device and cloud-based AI services.

Microsoft already offers its marquee AI feature, Copilot, to users, but is continuing to expand on the software to give users more reasons to upgrade to AI PCs.
Microsoft isn’t the only company using AI as a major selling point. Apple has already rolled out its first set of Apple Intelligence features for its iPhone, iPad, and Mac line of products, and Google is outfitting its software and Pixel line of phones with its own AI.
It’s difficult to tell if consumers are truly interested in AI just yet, though. If you want Microsoft’s latest Surface laptop outfitted with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip—an excellent device—you’re buying an AI PC, even if that wasn’t your intention. Ditto if you buy a new iPhone. Even if you’re not interested in the AI features, you’re still buying an AI smartphone.
We’ll have to wait and see just how many users end up taking advantage of AI PC and AI smartphone software and how often they use it to get a better sense of whether the categories are successes in and of themselves.

20241122,MSFT,"Nokia Corporation NOK recently revealed it has secured a five-year extension of its agreement with Microsoft, strengthening its position as the key supplier for Azure cloud infrastructure. The deal will accelerate Microsoft’s global footprint expansion initiatives and effectively support massive growth in compute workloads.

SONiC (Software for Open Networking in the Cloud) is an open-source network operating system extensively used by large-scale cloud data centers and service providers. Nokia boasts a strong research and innovation foundation on SONiC (Software for Open Networking in the Cloud) capabilities.

Nokia is set to supply its 7250 IXR-10e platform, which provides multi-terabyte-scale interconnectivity to address the growing bandwidth demands within Microsoft datacenters. Nokia will also deploy SONiC-based routers and data center switches to facilitate Microsoft’s transition to 400GE connectivity from 100GE. These advanced solutions will augment the speed and reliability of Microsoft’s data center infrastructure, enabling it to maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly growing cloud service market.
Will This Venture Drive NOK’s Share Performance?
The deal will expand Nokia’s global footprint to over 30 countries and also strengthen the company's position as a strategic and reliable supplier for tier-one hyperscale companies like Microsoft. With the surging demand for general compute and data traffic, enterprises worldwide are looking to enhance their data center infrastructure to improve network capacity.

Craig Newmark, the 71-year-old founder and former CEO of classifieds site Craigslist, is alarmed about potential cybersecurity risks in the US.
“The deal is our country is under attack now,” he told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). “It’s not like I’m in the recruiting line after Pearl Harbor because my dad volunteered in the '40s, but I guess that’s what I should be doing.”
Newmark, who stepped down from the company in 2000 but kept a position answering customer complaints, has foregone reaping financial rewards in semi-retirement.
Instead, he started Craig Newmark Philanthropies to primarily invest in projects to protect critical American infrastructure from cyberattacks. He told Sozzi he is now spending $200 million more to address the issue, on top of an initial $100 million pledge revealed in September of this year.
He encouraged other wealthy people to join him in the fight against cyberattacks.
“I tell people, 'Hey, the people who protect us could use some help. The amounts of money comparatively are small, so why not help out,'” he said.

Cybersecurity has had a banner year in the spotlight, with issues going beyond past annoyances where consumers simply need to change passwords, call a credit bureau, or cancel an account after a breach.
This past summer, a Microsoft (MSFT) Windows update containing a defect hit 8.5 million computers. It resulted in flight cancellations and hampered health and payment services. Concerns swirled about potential infrastructure attacks on a global scale, such as the Paris Olympics.
In October, utility company American Water Works (AWK) announced a cybersecurity attack that temporarily shut down its customer portal and paused billing.

Shares of cybersecurity stocks have subsequently soared: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) are up 38% and 53% year to date, respectively. Wall Street is staying bullish on each stock, according to Yahoo Finance analyst recommendation and price target data.
The global financial impact of cybercrimes could reach $13.82 trillion by 2028 from $9.22 trillion in 2024, the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia estimated.
The need for municipalities and other government entities to act rather than react remains paramount, warns Newmark.
“I think a lot about this,” said Newmark. “I’ve started to fund networks of smart volunteers who can help people protect infrastructure, particularly [for] the small companies and utilities across the country who are responsible for most of our electrical and power supplies, transportation infrastructure, [and] food distribution.”

“A lot of these systems have no protection, so an adversary could just compromise them, saying unless you do what we need, we can start shutting off these things,” he continued. Should that happen, recovery “could take weeks and weeks without your water supply or electricity.""
Newmark is a self-professed tech nerd. The IBM alum worked at Big Blue for 17 years before founding Craigslist in 1995.
While he continues to follow Craigslist from afar, Newmark said these days he's most focused on ensuring his wealth ends up at the correct causes.
""My deal is that I want all that money to go straight to the nonprofit world — I just have to figure out where that goes and how do I handle it over the next five to 20 years,"" Newmark said.

The warning was included in the biannual Financial Stability Review, a report that lists the risks that could threaten the financial well being of world markets.

Per the ECB, this concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble. It added that in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointing. The ECB further underlined that investors were demanding a low premium to own shares and bonds while funds had cut their cash buffers. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments, the ECB said.

“2023 was really a year of industry and businesses wrapping their heads around AI. 2024 is the year we’re starting to see real-scale deployments of our technology”.
Countless innovations in AI prove how the technology continues to be a strong force today. In the latest news, Enfabrica, a California-based startup that aims to make AI chips work more efficiently together at scale, recently announced that it has raised $115 million in funding and plans to release its newest chip early next year.
The startup is tackling one of the biggest technical problems that has emerged in the AI field. The problem is related to tying tens of thousands (or more) of chips together with a network.  The chip company strives to allow computing chips to simultaneously talk to more parts of a network.
According to co-founder and CEO Rochan Sankar, current systems can link about 100,000 AI chips before the network slows down. Sankar says chips from Enfabrica could increase this figure to about 500,000 chips, making it possible to train even larger AI models.
“It’s become apparent in the last six to nine months that the attributes of that network really drive the capability of that (computing power), whether it’s bandwidth, resiliency or recovery from loss. All these things matter when you start running at scale.”
In other news, OpenAI has recently launched a free training course for teachers with non-profit partner Common Sense Media. The training will enable teachers to understand artificial intelligence and use it efficiently. The move comes amid OpenAI promoting a positive image of ChatGPT in education. Previously, ChatGPT had been causing a frenzy as it helped students spin-off papers, complete their homework, and even write novels.

It has deployed more than 250,000 sensors and has reached $80 million in revenue. These figures are impressive since the startup managed to do this without raising any outside capital.

20241122,CRWD,"This earnings season may be winding down but there are still a number of companies reporting in the coming week.
Markets will be keeping an eye on Dell's latest results to see if demand for its Nvidia-powered artificial intelligence (AI) servers can continue to drive momentum at the computer maker, after the company raised its annual forecasts in the previous quarter.
Investors will also be looking to chipmaker Analog Devices' earnings for clues on the health of broader US economic activity, given the range of sectors its serves.
Meanwhile, football club Manchester United is set to release its first quarter results just days after Ruben Amorim makes his debut as manager of the Premier League team.
In retail, Urban Outfitters is to report, after having posted record second-quarter sales back in August.
Back on the UK market, investors will want to see if easyJet is reaping the benefits of continued rising demand for air travel.
Here's more on what to look out for:
Dell Technologies (DELL) — Reports third quarter results on Tuesday 26 November
Shares in computer maker Dell were among those that rose on the back of Nvidia's (NVDA) highly-anticipated third quarter earnings release, as the chipmaker beat estimates on key metrics, which boosted partner stocks.
The attention now turns to Dell's own third-quarter earnings, which are due out on Tuesday.
The computer hardware maker raised its annual revenue profit forecast on the back of its second quarter results, saying that it expected revenue to come in between $95.5bn (£76.2bn) and $98.5bn, according to Reuters.
In the second quarter, Dell reported a 9% rise in revenue year-on-year to $25bn, with server and network revenues soaring 80% to $7.7bn, linked to raising AI demand.

Yvonne McGill, chief financial officer at Dell Technologies, said that the company's momentum in its infrastructure solutions group business was a ""significant tailwind"", with a record revenue of $11.6bn, which was up 38% year-on-year.
This part of the business includes AI-optimised servers which are powered by Nvidia's chips.
Dell shares soared following the release of its second quarter results in August, with the stock up 82% year-to-date.
The company's recent performance marked an improvement from earlier in the year, with Dell having revealed a 2.5% fall in gross margins in the first quarter due to slower demand for its AI servers.
Dell then reportedly announced a fresh round of job cuts in August as part of reorganisation of its sales teams with a new unit focused on AI.

Bloomberg reported that Dell sales executives Bill Scannell and John Byrne had said the business was getting ""leaner"" and was ""streamlining layers of management and reprioritizing where we invest"".

Analog Devices (ADI) — Reports fourth quarter results on Tuesday 26 November
Chipmaker Analog Devices is considered as a valuable barometer of economic activity in the US and globally.
It specialises in analogue, mixed-signal processing, and power management chips, serving more than 125,000 customers across diverse sectors, offering more than 75,000 products. Just over half of its sales are driven by industrial markets, a quarter by the automotive sector, with the remainder coming from communications and consumer applications.
Analog Devices' shares have been volatile this year, which has meant the stock is less than 8% in the green year-to-date.
However, the company's CEO Vincent Roche noted a ""nascent recovery"" in the business cycle in the third quarter.

Revenue for this period came in at $2.3bn, which was above the midpoint of its outlook, with growth in industrial, consumer and communications areas of the business. However, this was 25% lower than the $3.1bn reported for the same period last year.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.79 for the third quarter, were 55% lower than the $1.74 reported in the previous year.
Richard Puccio, chief financial officer for Analog Devices, said: ""Improved customer inventory levels and order momentum, across most of our markets, position us to grow again sequentially in our fourth quarter, increasing our confidence that we are past the trough of this cycle.
""However, economic and geopolitical uncertainty continues to limit the pace of the recovery.""
For the fourth quarter, Analog Devices forecasted revenue of $2.4bn, plus or minus $100m and expected a reported operating margin of around 22.3%, as well as reported earnings per share of $0.85.

EasyJet (EZJ.L) — Reports full year results on Wednesday 27 November
Budget airline easyJet was among the low-cost carriers that had been slapped with a fine by Spain's consumer rights ministry, according to an announcement on Friday.
EasyJet, along with Ryanair (RYA.IR), International Airlines Group's (IAG.L) Vueling, fellow Spanish airlines Volotea and Norwegian Air Shuttle, have been fined a combined combined €179m (£149m).
In a statement released Friday, the ministry said the fines were over ""abusive practices such as charging extra for hand luggage or reserving adjacent seats to accompany dependent persons"", according to a translation.
EasyJet was fined €29m of the total amount, though shares were still more than 1% in the green by Friday afternoon.
Looking to the easyJet's upcoming earnings on Wednesday, this will be the last set of results with Johan Lundgren as CEO, before chief financial officer, Kenton Jarvis, takes the reins in January.

Analysts are expecting easyJet to post a headline pre-tax profit of £595m for the year, according to AJ Bell's investment experts Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatswort. This would be up from £455m a year ago.
Key metrics behind this headline figure include capacity, which is expected to have grown 8% to 100 million in the year to September 2024. Airline revenue per seat is among the other figures that analysts will be watching, with a benchmark of £79.84 last year.
In terms of dividends, analysts are expecting a payout of 12p per share, with this anticipated to rise to 14.8p for the year ending September 2025.
Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that easyJet's last set of results ""landed well with markets, who had become nervous after rival Ryanair issued a weak performance over the same period. But easyJet bucked the trend by selling a higher percentage of its available seats for the fourth quarter, despite increasing its capacity by 7%.
""This was enough to reassure investors that the group remains on the right flight path to deliver another record-breaking summer,"" he said.
Chiekrie added: ""Recent industry data shows that air travel demand continues to soar higher, and investors are eager to hear what easyJet sees on the horizon in next week’s results.”

20241122,CRWD,"The upcoming report from CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a decline of 1.2% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $982.26 million, representing an increase of 25% year over year.
The current level reflects no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.
Ahead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.
While investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.
With that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some CrowdStrike metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.
The collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- Subscription' of $936.57 million. The estimate suggests a change of +27.7% year over year.
The consensus estimate for 'Revenue- Professional services' stands at $49.04 million. The estimate indicates a change of -6.7% from the prior-year quarter.
Analysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- United States' to reach $682.66 million. The estimate indicates a change of +26.9% from the prior-year quarter.
Based on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Annual recurring revenue (ARR)' should arrive at $4,001,747.00. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $3,150,000.
Analysts expect 'Non-GAAP subscription gross profit' to come in at $752.42 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $588.69 million.
According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Non-GAAP professional services gross profit' should come in at $16.57 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $23.02 million in the same quarter of the previous year.
Analysts' assessment points toward 'GAAP professional services gross profit' reaching $11.95 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $17.38 million.
It is projected by analysts that the 'GAAP subscription gross profit' will reach $734.84 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $573.63 million.

20241122,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +17.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.
The consensus earnings estimate of $3.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.25 indicates a change of +17.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $982.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.9 billion and $4.76 billion estimates indicate +27.5% and +22.2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
CrowdStrike reported revenues of $963.87 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. EPS of $1.04 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $958.58 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +6.12%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
CrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Is artificial intelligence a tool for the rich countries and the wealthy? Even if it is, Chinese President Xi Jinping warns that it shouldn’t be. At the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Xi noted that AI shouldn’t be a game of the affluent, calling on more international governance and cooperation on the matter. In a separate meeting in Peru, Xi and Joe Biden also agreed that human beings, and not artificial intelligence, should be making decisions about nuclear weapons, as reported by The White House.

The call for equitable AI development and responsible decision-making underscores the growing global focus on AI's impact, and all the latest developments being made in the AI realm. As the global race to advance AI accelerates, one country striving to secure its position in this competitive landscape is Japan. The country is reportedly readying a $65-billion push in microchips and artificial intelligence, as revealed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this month. The move comes amid the country’s efforts to reclaim its status as a global tech leader.
News like these underscores how artificial intelligence continues to be a dominant theme in the business world. A Cisco 2024 AI Readiness Report reveals how companies around the world realize that the momentum for AI deployment is building fast, pulling up immense pressure on them in the process. However, only 13% of companies are ready to leverage AI and AI-powered technologies to their full potential. This is a 1-point decline from last year. Even though organizations are doing their best to leverage AI, the ROI is nowhere in the picture for many.
According to an AI consultant Rider Harris, some major reasons for companies failing to reap ROIs are that they probably invested in a bad tool, they weren’t trained enough (or at all), there’s a lack of excitement on the fear that AI may take their job away, or there may even be a lack of resources for employees to adequately make use of or navigate those tools.  This is why focusing on aspects such as training employees, getting them excited about the AI tool, and providing adequate resources can go a long way.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

With Donald Trump having won the elections, it seems Elon Musk is going to be a powerful force in the administration.  After all, X CEO has played an outsized role in his comeback, contributing millions to his campaign, serving as policy advisor, and even using his social media platform as a Make America Great Again (MAGA) advocacy platform.
Now that his efforts have come to fruition Max Tegmark, a leading scientist, who has previously worked with the world’s richest person says Musk’s influence could lead to tougher safety standards for artificial intelligence, as reported by The Guardian.
READ NOW: 15 AI News Stories Shaking Up Wall Street and 15 AI News That Broke The Internet
Tegmark says Musk’s backing of a failed AI bill demonstrated that Musk is still worried about the repercussions of uncontrolled AI development. The SB 1047 bill in California required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them.
Having frequently warned that such an unrestrained development can be catastrophic for humanity, Musk was one of the 30,000 others who had signed a letter calling for a pause on the development of advanced AI technology last year.
According to Tegmark, Musk could convince Trump to introduce standards that prevent the growth of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a term used for AI systems that match or surpass human levels of intelligence.
“I do think that if Elon manages to get Trump’s ear on AI issues we’re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI. He might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.”
Before Trump won the elections, Musk had predicted the development of artificial intelligence that would be smarter than the smartest human being by next year or by 2026.
""If you define AGI (artificial general intelligence) as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably next year, within two years”.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)
Market Capitalization: $84.07 billion
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity technology company that uses artificial intelligence to automate and improve cyber protection, learning from more than 2 trillion incidents every day to enhance accuracy.
On Monday, November 18, Truist raised the firm’s price target on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) to $375 from $325 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The analyst, rating the stock as part of a broader research note previewing Q3 results for the Infrastructure & Security Software names, notes that buyer behavior has been stabilizing and the firm is focused on visibility into 2025 when generative AI projects will have a “rubber meets the road” moment. In particular, the firm believes that Crowdstrike’s recent challenges, especially its global IT outage on July 19th, may lead to lower upsell revenue. There may also be a greater-than-normal decrease in business/ revenue due to longer-than-usual subscription durations following its global IT outage.
Overall CRWD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves right now. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241122,CRWD,"CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity leader, with a growth strategy centered on becoming the one-stop solution for all enterprise cybersecurity needs through platform expansion. Fundamentally, the company has a high-quality and stable earnings profile, driven by its strong recurring revenue base from the continued adoption of new product modules. At CrowdStrike's FY24 Investor Day, management announced its goal of reaching $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, which is supported by a strong free cash flow margin. However, this goal was affected by the global outage on July 19, which was due to the company releasing a flawed sensor configuration update for its Falcon platform, resulting in around 8.5 million Windows devices crashing. This caused significant reputational damage to the cybersecurity leader, as the outage led to grounded flights, canceled medical procedures and widespread disruption. Following this incident, the stock took a sharp dive, dropping from $345 to $264 on July 22, as investors reacted to the news.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRWD.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
CRWD Data by GuruFocus
The repercussions from the July 19 outage was revealed when the company reported its Q2 FY25 earnings. Despite the outage, the company managed to outperform wall-street analysts' revenue and earnings expectations, leading to a 3% stock price increase following the earnings release. However, with its Q2 FY25 earnings results, management released its lowered top-line and bottom-line guidance for the upcoming quarters. Despite this lowered guidance, the stock largely rebounded, and is now in line with the S&P 500's YTD returns. My long-term investment perspective for CrowdStrike lies on one key trend in cybersecurity: the growing demand from enterprise customers to consolidate multiple-vendor solutions onto a single platform to cut costs. Consequently, the recent macroeconomic pressures have forced enterprise customers to focus on efficiency and find ways to do more with less. Thus, this key trend remains strong and I believe CrowdStrike is well-positioned to benefit, as it provides one of the top platforms in the market at significant cost-savings.
The Falcon Platform: One-Stop Shop
CrowdStrike is basically known as an endpoint protection company in the cybersecurity market, but I don't think this fully captures the scope of services that the company currently offers. In reality, it operates as a one-stop platform for enterprise cybersecurity solutions, which was a key point highlighted during its Q2 FY25 earnings presentation. While there are many competitors in the industry, no other competitor is able to offer the scope of services that CrowdStrike does. Thus, as mentioned previously, I believe that CrowdStrike is positioned well to benefit in a time where enterprises are increasingly looking to consolidate its cybersecurity infrastructure. As a result, CrowdStrike's platform is able to serve as a consolidated solution, which is difficult to compete with in the current cybersecurity landscape.

CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
[CrowdStrike IR]
George Kurtz (CEO of CrowdStrike) pointed out that enterprise customers are focused on efficiency and reducing complexity, noting that Customers don't want to go backwards and have a patchwork of products. They are still focused on the consolidation piece and they're looking at us as one of the key consolidators in the market"". What was actually meant by this statement is evident in the fact that about 65% of the company's customers use five or more modules, 45% use six or more and 30% use seven or modules. Furthermore, among larger customers that spend over $100,000 annually on CrowdStrike's services, nearly half use eight or more modules. This highlights the depth of the consolidation in CrowdStrike's cybersecurity customer portfolio, making it significantly challenging to compete with.
Further, I found a research piece from Gartner that noted that 75% of enterprise customers are actively looking to decrease the number of cybersecurity vendors that they work with, further supporting the industry trend of vendor consolidation. Thus, the primary goal for enterprise customers is to increase integration and lower vendor management costs, and this shift will likely result in a handful of dominant players emerging in the market. Given CrowdStrike's early focus on consolidation through its Falcon platform, it is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
Post-Outage Recovery
Post the outage on July 19, CrowdStrike experienced some disruption in its sales pipeline with a few deals placed on hold, and to be finalized in subsequent quarters. Consequently, management clarified to investors that the larger part of those delayed deals would still stay in the pipeline. That said, investors should be prepared to hear that some of the new customers are going to be more cautious than usual, since the company has lost some trust within the marketplace as a result of the outage. During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, CFO Burt Podbere noted the following: ""We expect to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, with additional scrutiny requiring higher levels of approval at the CEO and, in some cases, Board of Directors level."" The meaning behind this is simple: the longer the list of approvals, the more protracted the sales cycle will be, especially in large corporations. Although the CFO didn't mention the exact delay periods, I expect bigger deals to take close to six months to finalize.
To address the situation, it appears that CrowdStrike has introduced customer commitment packages, wherein the company gives a discount and other incentives to their customers in return for signing longer-term contracts. This may, however, affect the company's revenues for the next few quarters, but it's important to note that CrowdStrike still managed to win several eight and nine-figure deals despite the outage. For example, within cloud security, CrowdStrike secured an eight-figure deal with a major enterprise software firm, which opted to standardize on Falcon Cloud Security across its entire business, replacing another next-gen cloud security vendor. Similarly, a nine-figure cloud security deal saw a large enterprise adopt Falcon Cloud Security across a million hosts, replacing other cloud security products.
In the Security information and event management (SIEM) market, CrowdStrike continues to outperform legacy SIEM providers. Two major deals stand out: an eight-figure deal with an existing customer, which replaced two legacy SIEMs with CrowdStrike's LogScale, resulting in over 60% cost savings, and a seven-figure deal with a leading generative AI company, which standardized on LogScale after a year of use, improving search speed, response times, and total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to their previous legacy SIEM solution.
Expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)
CrowdStrike's growth story is further supported by the expanding TAM. In 2024, the TAM for cybersecurity is expected to be around $100 billion, but this figure is projected to grow to $225 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8%. Even if CrowdStrike only manages to grow in line with the market, the company has a long runway for growth. Given its platformization strategy, I believe CrowdStrike is positioned to outpace market growth and capture significant market share.
Strong Results Despite Challenges
CrowdStrike's Q2 FY25 results, in my view, basically showcase the company's resilience and strength, even in the face of significant adversity (with the recent outage and macro pressures). The company reported revenue of $964 million (up 31.7% YoY), overperforming wall-street guidance by $5.5 million. With 94% of its revenue coming from subscriptions, the growth in this segment is a key indicator of CrowdStrike's performance. Subscription revenue grew 33% YoY, while ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) was up 32%, reaching $3.9 billion. This included $218 million in net new ARR, an 11% increase YoY, in line with the company's guidance.

[CrowdStrike IR]
CrowdStrike also reported record non-GAAP operating income of $227 million, representing a 46% YoY increase, signaling excellent operational efficiency. Notably, non-GAAP operating income is growing faster than revenue, demonstrating the company's operating leverage, a key strength in the tech sector, where many companies prioritize growth over profitability.
Robust Cash Flow Generation
Free cash flows increased by 44% YoY to $272 million in Q2 FY25, with a 28% free cash flow margin, highlighting the company's ability to fund its own growth. The company achieved what it calls the ""rule of 60"" during the quarter. This means that the sum of its YoY revenue growth rate (approximately 32%) and its free cash flow margin (28%) equals 60. The term is derived from the ""rule of 40,"" a concept introduced by Brad Feld, who describes it as the idea that a company's growth rate combined with its profitability should total at least 40%. For example, a 20% growth rate should correspond with a 20% profit margin, while a 50% growth rate could be paired with a 10% loss. Exceeding this benchmark is rare, which is why investors tend to value CrowdStrike more highly compared to other growth stocks.
Lowered Management Guidance
Although the company reported great Q2 FY25 results despite the outage, the repercussions of the outage is largely reflected in CrowdStrike's full-year guidance. Management lowered its initial revenue guidance for FY25 by 1.5%, now expecting revenue to be between $3.896 billion and $3.989 billion, down from the original forecast of $3.924 billion to $3.989 billion. Non-GAAP operating income guidance was also reduced by 11.23%, with the new midpoint at $788.5 million, down from $888.3 million. While Q3 FY25 is expected to show continued revenue growth of 34.2%, non-GAAP operating income growth is forecasted to slow to 8.3%, reflecting the near-term impact of the outage on profitability.
Capacity For Continued Investments
I have already mentioned Crowdstrike's ability to drive impressive revenue growth and operational efficiency. But, in addition to this, the reason that I'm bullish on the company is mainly due to the fact that CrowdStrike's fundamental strengths are also backed by its commitment to reinvest back into the core business. Looking at the closest rival to CrowdStrike (Palo Alto Networks), CrowdStrike's Capex to CFO ratio is relatively higher. Although Palo Alto Networks has larger R&D capex spending in absolute terms, if CRWD sustains its impressive CFO growth, it will likely close the gap with PANW soon. CrowdStrike's top-line and CFO is growing much faster compared to rivals.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
CRWD Data by GuruFocus
Strong Balance Sheet
CrowdStrike also maintains a solid balance sheet. As of Q2 FY25, the company held $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents against $743.2 million in long-term debt, giving it a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of 0.28. Furthermore, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.75 suggests that CrowdStrike can comfortably manage its debt using operating profits. Furthermore, while some competitors and investors overhyped the potential for CrowdStrike to lose business, the company's operating leverage remains on track. With its continued focus on platform consolidation, I expect CrowdStrike to maintain its leadership position and recover from the recent setbacks caused by the outage.
Valuation Thoughts
From a valuation standpoint, I am quite optimistic about CrowdStrike's potential. I believe CrowdStrike is currently trading at a significant discount, especially when considering the several growth catalysts that will unfold in both the short and long term. At the moment, CrowdStrike is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23x, which is well below its five-year historical average of 29x. This disparity may suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its historical valuation, presenting a unique buying opportunity for investors. In the near term, I anticipate that CrowdStrike's stock may experience some additional drawdowns as investors reassess their positions in light of the recent outage. However, I view this as a temporary phase, which could provide a compelling entry point for those who may have missed out on the stock during its earlier growth stages.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
CRWD Data by GuruFocus
Historically, CrowdStrike's P/S ratio has been considerably higher, so I expect that as the company fully recovers from the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) incident, its valuation will revert closer to the five-year average of 29x. Given these factors, I'm setting a target multiple of 27x, which would imply a price target of around $375 per share. This represents an upside of approximately 20%, which, in my opinion, provides a solid margin for investors to take advantage of at current levels.
CrowdStrike: Positioned for Growth Amidst Short-Term Challenges
[Alpha Spread]
From a discounted cash flow (DCF) perspective, I used a discount rate of 8% (which reflects the company's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC) and applied a conservative terminal growth rate of 5%. This DCF analysis aligns with Wall Street's growth forecasts for CrowdStrike over the next five years, which reflects a topline-growth rate of 15% over the next five years and some operating leverage improvements as the company expands beyond endpoint protection and solidifies its position as a leader in platform consolidation, offering a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity services. The scalability and robustness of the Falcon platform have already been proven, supporting the optimistic outlook from analysts. Based on this DCF model, I derive an upside of roughly 19% (with a target price of $408), which I believe offers ample margin for value investors seeking to capitalize on CrowdStrike's current valuation. Given the company's strong fundamentals, its recovery potential, and the broader market opportunity, I see this as an attractive entry point for those looking to invest at these levels.
Conclusion
Despite the recent outage and its immediate challenges, I remain confident in CrowdStrike's long-term growth potential. The company's current market position, and the strategy towards platform consolidation positions it well to capitalize on the growing trend of enterprise customers seeking to streamline their cybersecurity solutions with a single provider to save costs and improve efficiency. Even after the setback (with regards to BSOD), CrowdStrike secured significant deals, demonstrating resilience and maintaining market trust. Additionally, with its current valuation appearing attractive compared to historical averages, a robust balance sheet, and a proven ability to drive growth through its Falcon platform, I see this as a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on its recovery and long-term market potential.

20241122,CRWD,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).
CrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 6.7% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.
ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank
In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.
Story Continues
The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.
Is CRWD a Good Investment?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.65.
Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike.

20241122,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) closed at $342.97 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.85% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.39% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.13%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.6%.
Shares of the cloud-based security company have appreciated by 8.58% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.59% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.06%.
Market participants will be closely following the financial results of CrowdStrike Holdings in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on November 26, 2024. On that day, CrowdStrike Holdings is projected to report earnings of $0.82 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $982.26 million, up 24.97% from the prior-year quarter.
Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $3.9 billion, indicating changes of +18.12% and +27.51%, respectively, compared to the previous year.
Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for CrowdStrike Holdings. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Our research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

20241122,CRWD,"Investor Alert-Could These Three Hot Tech Stocks Be About To Split
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
Owning a hot stock can enrich investors in many ways and the more shares investors own, the more money they stand to make. That's why a stock split, which multiplies the number of shares an investor owns or that an investor can buy, always makes big news. Hot tech stocks are prone to splitting when their share price gets excessively high and there is speculation these three tech stocks could be primed for a split.

CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD)
If you've ever surfed the web, you have likely used a website that uses CrowdStrike to keep the site secure. Since its IPO in 2019, CrowdStrike has established itself as one of the world's most recognizable cloud-based cybersecurity companies. Back then, its shares traded for only $34, but today, a share in CrowdStrike will set you back a hefty $336.
CrowdStrike occupies a large market share, largely because it's one of the few cybersecurity companies that provide its services via cloud apps instead of directly installing applications like DVDs. This approach allows Crowdstrike's biggest clients, many of which are tech companies or have extensive Web-based operations, to keep the same service as their operations expand.
Crowdstrike's reputation hit in the summer when it experienced a global outage that knocked some of the world's biggest tech companies offline. Despite that, the company's public filings show that CrowdStrike became profitable in 2024. More importantly, analysts expect this stock's earnings per share (EPS) to grow by over 70% by 2027. If CrowdStrike hits those targets, this stock price may shoot so high that a split becomes a strong possibility.
Trending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.
MongoDB (Nasdaq: MDB)
MongoDB manufactures database management software that allows companies more options for upscaling or customization. This flexibility lets MongoDB clients store and access their important data in the way that best suits the client instead of having to adapt to the traditional, structured method of database management offered by competing businesses.
Story Continues
MongoDB's IPO was in 2017 when shares in this tech company cost only $24. Today, MongoDB shares have surged to nearly $280 and its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 40% from 2018 to 2024. Although the company has yet to turn a profit, analysts at Barclays and Citigroup have recently upgraded their price targets for MongoDB to $345 and $400. If the analyst predictions are correct, MongoDB shares could be primed for a split.

ASML (Nasdaq: ASML)
Semiconductors are mission-critical components in AI applications and ASML is a global leader in manufacturing lithography systems fo semiconductors superconductors. These systems work by using advanced optics to imprint circuit patterns onto microchips. This Dutch-based company counts some of the world's foremost tech companies, including Samsung and Intel as its clients.
ASML's Q3 2024 report showed a nearly 60% increase over Q3 2023 and company management predicted revenue would exceed $63 billion by 2030. This company has been around since 1995 and its stock has split four times. The last one came in 2007, but ASML's share price has jumped by nearly 1,500% to the current price of $658.63. Another bonus for ASML shareholders is that it pays a dividend of 0.098% ($6.45/share).
Considering this stock's previous history of splitting and its current sky-high share price, it's not hard to imagine ASML getting set for another split at some point in the future. In the meantime, analysts at JP Morgan and Wells Fargo have given ASML a ""buy now"" rating. The buy-in isn't cheap, but the prospect of earning a dividend and a future stock split makes ASML worth some attention from tech investors.
Diversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate
While Realty Income is undoubtedly a solid choice for investors seeking consistent monthly dividend income, it's important to remember that publicly traded stocks are subject to market volatility. For those looking to diversify their income streams and potentially reduce exposure to market fluctuations, real estate investing through platforms like Arrived is worth considering.
Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio.

20241122,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 26% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Check out our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings
How To Calculate Return On Equity?
The formula for ROE is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for CrowdStrike Holdings is:
6.0% = US$175m ÷ US$2.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.
What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
CrowdStrike Holdings' Earnings Growth And 6.0% ROE
On the face of it, CrowdStrike Holdings' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that CrowdStrike Holdings grew its net income at a significant rate of 28% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
We then compared CrowdStrike Holdings' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period.
NasdaqGS:CRWD Past Earnings Growth November 18th 2024
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is CRWD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.

Is CrowdStrike Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?
Given that CrowdStrike Holdings doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.
Conclusion
On the whole, we do feel that CrowdStrike Holdings has some positive attributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

20241122,AVGO,"While Nvidia (NVDA) continues dominating the AI chip market, investors seek additional opportunities in the rapidly evolving sector. Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations.
Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry.
Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options.
Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: ""It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software — and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.""

Chicago, IL – November 22, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of Stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Merck & Co., Inc. MRK, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM and Natural Health Trends Corp. NHTC.
Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:
Top Analyst Reports for Broadcom, Merck and Qualcomm
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Broadcom’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company’s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.
However, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom’s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.
(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)
Merck’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.
Yet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.
(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)
Shares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.
Story Continues
Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.
However, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space. The company formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions.
(You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)
Shares of Natural Health Trends have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+1.8% vs. +21.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, a declining active member base remains the biggest concern for the company. It faces liquidity challenges and high operating expenses. Dependency on key markets and intense competition pose additional risks.
However, expansion into new markets and improvement in cost management bode well.

20241122,AVGO,"Investor confidence in certain major companies has propelled markets higher, but there are also those betting against big-name stocks through short selling amid continued uncertainty.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly topped the 6,000-point mark in the recent rally following Donald Trump's election win, though they have since eased back, with the main US index closing Wednesday's session flat at 5,917.
While markets broadly rose following the US election, there were a particular group of stocks that rallied in what has been dubbed the ""Trump trade"", around expectations as to the policies that the Republican president-elect could look to implement after he returns to the White House in January.
One of which was Tesla (TSLA), as the electric carmaker's CEO Elon Musk was a major supporter of Trump's campaign and has since been nominated by the president-elect to co-lead the recently announced Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The post-election rally in Tesla stock pushed its market valuation to over the $1tn mark, which was welcome news for investors that are bullish about the company's prospects.
However, not all investors were reaping the benefits, as data from S3 Partners showed that short-sellers had lost nearly $8bn by the Monday after the election, according to Business Insider.
Unlike the traditional way of investing in markets by buying shares with the goal of selling them at a higher price, also known as going ""long"", short selling aims to make a profit on the declining price of the stock. An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.
The hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.
And while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.
Analysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in the last month.
Here are the major companies that have become popular shorts.
Popular short stocks
S3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.
Story continues
Chipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.
The demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.
At the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.
Shares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.
And Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.

The discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.
Tesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.
However, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve ""slight growth"" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.
S3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).
Following its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.
S&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this ""may be related to the [US] election"".
They said that despite this significant activity in ""all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses"".
Global short bets
Meanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.
The data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on ""crowdedness"", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors’ supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.
LVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.
The company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an ""uncertain economic and geopolitical environment"" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.

The luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.
Kering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.
Shares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.
Multinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.
Diageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.
It has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.
In South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.

Hindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were ""nothing but a lie"".
On Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.
Shares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.
In a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were ""baseless"".
Hindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.
However, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.

(AVGO) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole?

20241122,AVGO,"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?
When Is Debt A Problem?
Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.
Check out our latest analysis for Broadcom
How Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?
The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.
NasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024
How Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?
We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.
Of course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.
In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).
Story Continues
Broadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.
Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.
Our View
When it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.
When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt. Readers can access a list of growth stocks with zero net debt 100% free, right now.

As NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market—and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO).
What To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry.
Broadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers—critical components for Nvidia’s AI-focused operations.
Don’t Miss:
Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.
This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.
A strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.
Historically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia’s during major market reactions. Nvidia’s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.
How To Buy AVGO Stock
By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.
Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.
If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

Economic data releases and earnings
Chip stocks are down 3% since the election. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure.
Once the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months.
Nvidia (NVDA) earnings — coming after the bell Wednesday — will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally.

Tom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday.
""It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,"" said Essaye. ""It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.""
Nvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock — up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years — hit record highs following the election.
But many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.
Semiconductor returns during the second half of 2024
The worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.
Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor — is down 14%.
The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous.

To be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday.
""Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],"" said Essaye.
Since the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia — ""priced to perfection"" according to many analysts — underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.
Story Continues
But Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this ""bellwether"" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.
""They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far,"" he said. ""I think they can do it again.""

20241122,AVGO,"We recently compiled a list of the Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.
When it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there’s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University’s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).
Founded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university’s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard’s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard’s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university’s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard’s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.
According to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia’s 11.5% or Brown’s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC’s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:
“In FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC’s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.”
Notably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from ""overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500."" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar’s strategy of overhauling the university’s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Harvard Management Company's Stake: $89.6 million
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the world’s largest technology companies, with operations spanning the hardware and software sectors. The company’s primary strength is in hardware, as it supplies networking and custom chips across diverse applications.
In its third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and robust non-AI semiconductor sales. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI revenue to grow 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the annual AI revenue to $12 billion, largely fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.
On November 6, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company’s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing “seasonal headwinds” linked to a product transition for Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.
Overall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's ""easy"" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some ""serious gains.""
""I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It’s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don’t count. But that, people, is nonsense.""
Cramer said banks do not ""care"" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation.
""I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I’m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds.""

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.
The company’s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“We continued to build our position in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers – such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few – will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA’s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.”

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. As of now, Broadcom Inc. holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).
With respect to valuation, Broadcom Inc. is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.95. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 32.63.
Also, we should mention that AVGO has a PEG ratio of 1.63. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Semiconductors was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.72 at yesterday's closing price.
The Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 131, finds itself in the bottom 49% echelons of all 250+ industries.

20241122,AVGO,"Broadcom: 3 Reasons We Love This Stock
Broadcom currently trades at $165.14 and has been a dream stock for shareholders. It’s returned 431% since November 2019, blowing past the S&P 500’s 87.9% gain. The company has also beaten the index over the past six months as its stock price is up 16.8%. This was partly thanks to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.
Is now still a good time to buy AVGO? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it’s free.
Why Is AVGO a Good Business?
Originally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.
1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum
A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Over the last five years, Broadcom grew its sales at an excellent 16% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).
Broadcom Quarterly Revenue
2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable
Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.
Broadcom’s management team is currently guiding for a 50.6% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect Broadcom’s revenue to grow 24.6% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus its 21.6% annualized growth rate for the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and implies its newer products and services will catalyze higher growth rates.
3. Excellent Free Cash Flow Boosts Reinvestment Potential
Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.
Broadcom has shown terrific cash profitability, and if sustainable, puts it in an advantageous position to invest in new products, return capital to investors, and consolidate the market during industry downturns. The company’s free cash flow margin was among the best in the semiconductor sector, averaging an eye-popping 43.8% over the last two years.

Final Judgment
These are just a few reasons why we think Broadcom is a great business, and with its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 28.2x forward price-to-earnings (or $165.14 per share).

20241122,AVGO,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this chipmaker have returned -8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Broadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 points to a change of +14% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate +44% and +16.7% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Broadcom Inc. reported revenues of $13.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.31%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Broadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Nvidia (NVDA) mania is heating up ahead of the market darling's earnings report on Wednesday.
The company is “representative of the most important stocks in America,” EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below).
Jackson reiterated his call that Nvidia's stock could double within the next 12 months given its wide lead in artificial intelligence chip production.
“The investments [in AI] are just getting started,” Jackson added. “The need for these chips is still going to continue for the next year or two or three.”
Nvidia's stock has surged more than 2,600% in the past five years, according to Yahoo Finance data, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabbed the top position in cutting-edge chips.
The company's strong performance is expected to continue in its fiscal third quarter — sales and profits are each estimated to be up 83% from a year ago. Wall Street remains bullish on its favorite stock.

Of the 63 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 59 rate the stock a Buy or Strong Buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. The average price target stands at $160.38, about 13% above current levels.
""We see the near-term risks as largely balanced and we are buyers of Nvidia heading into its fiscal third quarter earnings report scheduled for Wednesday,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a client note on Monday. ""Positive set-up indicators from accelerating bookings at cloud service providers, an upward bias on hyper-scale capital expenditures, as well as our view that near-term estimates will increase post the earnings call.""
Lipacis said that if Nvidia were to let investors down, it would come in the form of decelerating revenue growth.

There has been a whirlwind of activity around Nvidia as of late.
In addition to achieving the world's most valuable company status by nudging out Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG), Nvidia joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Nov. 8. Former chip leader Intel (INTC) was kicked out.
“It’s good that Nvidia is part of the mix now,” Jackson said, noting it could encourage purchases from retail investors.
One potential hiccup is the restrictions around selling to China by the Biden administration and subsequent write-downs, which were a “meaningful part of their quarterly earnings,” Jackson said. “They had to take it down to zero.”

Incoming president Donald Trump could stay firm on the chip issue as well, making good on his campaign promises around China.
""The good news for investors is that they’ve written everything down and so if anything comes from the relationship with China and Nvidia, it’s going to be great,” Jackson said.
Wall Street will be hard-pressed to downgrade Nvidia's stock in the medium term.

20241122,NOW,"ServiceNow stock (NOW) has been on a roll recently, boasting over 55% one-year returns, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500. While many are still bullish on further upside in the stock, we believe it's time to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the profits.
ServiceNow specializes in digital workflow automation, providing cloud-based workflow automation solutions that help organizations improve their operations. Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.
The company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.
Hard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage
The rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.
Approximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.
Some of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.
Our bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft’s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.
Carahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn’t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company’s future relations with the government.
In a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.
This also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn’t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock’s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.

In recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.
""We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously”

This news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a “wall”. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI’s Orion is “so far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI’s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.”
However, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is “no wall”. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it’s possible to have reached a turning point.
“We haven’t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we’ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.”
Gary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:
“The economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense…”
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Strong Portfolio Aids NOW’s Prospects
ServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW’s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.
ServiceNow’s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media and technology, financial services and the public sector.

Strong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive
A strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.
NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.
The strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.
In the third quarter of 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.
NOW’s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation
However, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.
In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.28, higher than its median of 13.74 and the sector’s 6.21.

20241122,NOW,"ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
ROE can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:
14% = US$1.3b ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.
What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
ServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE
To start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.
NYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.
Story Continues
Is ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?
ServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Conclusion
On the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

20241122,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:
“When it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.”

Cramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.
Another sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.
While some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.
Similarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they’re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.
As for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they’ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.
Story Continues
“We need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we’re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.”

Cramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.’s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:
“Let's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive… Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market… Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting… Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again… Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.
Additionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company’s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.
Overall NOW ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

Sovereign AI: a new concept gaining traction in the realm of artificial intelligence. As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing “sovereign” artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to “codify” a country’s culture, history, and collective intelligence.

That said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent’s competitiveness and technological resilience.
Filippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they “understand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.”
“As this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.”
While AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.
Latest Advancements in AI
In recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon’s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe’s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world’s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.
“WoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification”.

Other fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.
In other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed “Operator”, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel.

20241122,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.
Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday’s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there’s a catch.
“What if the Treasury doesn’t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.”
READ ALSO Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks and Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins
Even though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.
Cramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump’s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board—on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains—no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it’s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:
“If it’s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses… It has always worked for the stock market.”
But Cramer warned that there’s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market’s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.
Story Continues
“If you believe we’re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.”

How ServiceNow Inc (NOW)’s AI Partnerships Are Driving Its Soaring Growth: Insights from Jim Cramer
A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.
ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)
Talking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:
“As is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn’t make a lot of sense and… we’re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications.

The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia’s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.
This partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.
For the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%. The company also expects a gross profit margin of 84.5% for its subscription services, with an operating income margin of 29.5% and a free cash flow margin of 31%.
Overall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks.

20241122,NOW,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL –November 15, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Toast TOST, as the Bull of the Day and Clean Harbors CLH, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Toast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.
The stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock’s ongoing upward momentum.
About the Company
Toast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.
With its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.
Its platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.
Toast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.
The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “A” in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a “F” in Value.
Q3 Earnings Beat
On November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.
Q3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.
The company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.
Gross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.
Management comments were overwhelmingly bullish:
“Toast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.”
Estimates Headed Higher
Analysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.
Story Continues
For the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.
For the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.
For the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.
Toast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote
With the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.
JPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.
The Technical Take
The stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO’d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.
After trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.
With the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.
Post earnings low: $36
Gap fill: $33
21-day: $32
50-day: $29.20
200-day: $25.20
Fibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32
While that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.
In Summary
Toast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.
The company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.
As Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.
Bear of the Day:
Clean Harbors  is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.
The company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?
With an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.
About the Company
Clean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).
The company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world’s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.
CLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “D” in Value, But “B” in both Momentum and Growth.
Q3 Earnings
The company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.
Despite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.
Positive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.
While there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.
Earnings Estimates
Estimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.
For the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.
Looking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.
For the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year’s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.
Technical Take
The drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.
This volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.
The drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.
The stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.
In Summary
Clean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.
With significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.

ServiceNow, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ServiceNow, Inc. Quote
The consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.
Strong Portfolio Aids NOW’s Prospects
ServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW’s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.
ServiceNow’s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.

This service will be available this November for Customer Service Management AI Agents and IT Service Management AI Agents. It is expected to reduce the time to resolve an issue and make live agents more productive.
Strong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive
A strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.
NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.
The strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.
In third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.
NOW’s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation
However, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.
In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector’s 6.37X.
We believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow’s premium valuation.
Conclusion
ServiceNow’s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.
ServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241122,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.
Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ to discuss the market’s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we’ve had some ""very good"" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.

Hickey’s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.
Developments in the AI Landscape
With AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn’t anyone who doesn’t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the “Future 40”. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.
Artificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure”, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China’s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act “as ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.”
Story Continues
As per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden’s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments “to give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure”, amongst other things.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

20241122,NOW,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ServiceNow (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
ServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.3% and 5.9% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying ServiceNow, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
Story Continues
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Should You Invest in NOW?
Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $13.87.
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.

20241122,NOW,"Over the past year, many ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
ServiceNow Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gina Mastantuono, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$958 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$1,046). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of Gina Mastantuono's holding.
Insiders in ServiceNow didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

ServiceNow Insiders Are Selling The Stock
The last three months saw significant insider selling at ServiceNow. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.
Insider Ownership Of ServiceNow
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. ServiceNow insiders own about US$387m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

20241122,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.
One conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC’s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.

Nevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity’s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn’t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.
While that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.
“The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever”.
In light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called ""time testing compute"" for improving models during the “inference” phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.
Recent AI Developments
Fortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry’s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.
Story Continues
In its first, an artificial intelligence company will be helping publishers rather than attempting to steal its work. While AI isn’t much appreciated in journalism because it seemingly uses journalist work to feed chatbot’s data demands and in turn diverts lesser traffic to the publisher, one startup, founded by Twitter engineers, believes that AI could be a valuable player in the media industry instead. Particle, an AI newsreader, will help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology, offering more than just a summary.
In other developments, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, says it will begin experimenting with ads this week.
“Ad programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners. Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. Advertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.”

20241122,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Will Go Higher in Trump Presidency. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer.
In a recent program, Jim Cramer celebrated the market’s rally on Donald Trump’s election victory, saying the market likes Trump.
“The market likes Donald J. Trump, and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both, and we had a monster celebration. It was a full jailbreak, and the bears never knew what trampled them. Now, though, with the inclusion of this amazing session, we have to ask: have you missed the Trump rally?”
Cramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.
“Trump wants to cut taxes—all taxes—including corporate taxes. Some numbers go higher, estimates go higher, earnings-per-share go higher. You do need to see interest rates go low for things to really work. Someday this is going to matter. It’s hard to keep doing this and piling on debt. But party on until we see damage; that’s what it felt like to me, seems to be the mantra.”
Cramer said the market is still “oversold” as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground. However, Cramer said the polls were again proved wrong.
Cramer then talked about the stocks that investors can buy to ride the Trump rally.

20241125,META,"We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.
With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.
Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.
Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that ""it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions."" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to ""prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.""
To prove that ""equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,"" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that ""market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House."" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.
Story Continues
The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.
Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank ""urges caution"" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.
Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'
Between then and now, the bank believes that ""generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage."" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms ""building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.""
While generative AI might be in the ""trough of disillusionment,"" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the ""overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032"" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.
Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.
However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.
According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is ""more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud."" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.
Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.
Our Methodology
To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)
Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations.
Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”
Overall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.
Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.
First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.
Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.
Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.
Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

Oaktree Capital’s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos
In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.
Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.
Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.
On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.
The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.

20241125,META,"By Jody Godoy
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms will face trial in April over the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's allegations that the social media platform bought Instagram and WhatsApp to crush emerging competition, a judge in Washington said on Monday.
The FTC sued in 2020, during the Trump administration, alleging the company acted illegally to maintain a monopoly on personal social networks. Meta, then known as Facebook, overpaid for Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to eliminate nascent threats instead of competing on its own in the mobile ecosystem, the FTC claims.
Judge James Boasberg set trial in the case for April 14.
Boasberg earlier this month rejected Meta's argument that the case should be dismissed as it depends on an overly narrow view of social media markets. The lawsuit does not account for competition from ByteDance's TikTok, Alphabet's YouTube, X, and Microsoft's LinkedIn, Meta had argued.
Boasberg said that while the case should go forward to trial, ""time and technological change pose serious challenges"" to the FTC's market definition.
""The Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial. Indeed, its positions at times strain this country's creaking antitrust precedents to their limits,"" the judge said in the Nov. 13 ruling.

Entrepreneurship in the United States has been surging since the pandemic and AI trends have served to bolster this phenomenon. Technology startups associated with AI have reached valuations in the tens of billions. Underpinning this situation is the rise in small businesses. According to the US Department of Treasury, an average of 430,000 new business applications were submitted monthly in 2024 — a 50% increase from 2019. However, the number of accountants needed to balance the books at these startups is diminishing. Per a report by tech news platform TechCrunch, nearly 75% of CPAs are projected to retire within a decade, and fewer graduates are pursuing accounting due to higher-paying opportunities in tech and finance.

David Phillips, a serial entrepreneur, has addressed this gap through his venture Fondo. Fondo uses AI, software, and accounting experts to offer a subscription-based bookkeeping platform tailored to startups and small businesses. The platform has already gained traction, securing 1,200 customers, achieving $6 million in annual recurring revenue, and becoming profitable. It recently closed a $7 million seed funding round led by Tokyo-based Money Forward, with investors like Y Combinator and Motley Fool Ventures. The round values Fondo at $66 million.

20241125,META,"Raymond James reiterated its ""Strong Buy"" rating for Meta Platforms Inc. (META, Financial), while Deutsche Bank maintained its $675 price target this Monday. The sentiment reflects Meta's ongoing efforts to integrate AI and GenAI into its services, with revenue growth anticipated by 2025.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.
Meta's growth drivers include its AI-based recommendation model, which is projected to boost user engagement by mid-single to low-double-digit percentages. Additionally, Meta AI Assistant, boasting over 500 million monthly active users (MAUs), is expected to push the search and assistant market beyond $10 billion by 2026, particularly in sectors like travel and entertainment.
Meta's 2025 capital expenditure forecast remains high, with Raymond James endorsing the company's investments in initiatives such as DLRM, Meta AI, and Llama projects. According to the firm, market expectations have already factored in this elevated capex, reducing its potential to adversely affect the stock.
Currently, Meta's stock is trading about five points below its market price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, with analysts forecasting a multiple expansion driven by AI and GenAI monetization.
Moreover, further growth is anticipated from the Reality Labs segment. Analysts predict that losses in this segment will peak next year as augmented reality technologies, such as smart glasses, see broader adoption.
Despite concerns over high valuation, Raymond James is confident that Meta's strategic focus and technological advancements will unlock sustainable long-term growth and position it as a leader in AI monetization.

Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.
Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.
The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.

20241125,META,"More than 6 million UK consumers have fallen prey to online fraudsters in the past year, with social media platforms and online marketplaces emerging as the most frequent avenues for scams, according to consumer watchdog Which?.
Figures reveal that approximately 6.6 million British shoppers have lost money to scams over the last 12 months, with nearly 5 million of those affected being targeted on popular platforms such as Facebook (META), Instagram, YouTube (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and WhatsApp.
These platforms, alongside others like TikTok, Google, and X (formerly Twitter), have been rife with scams that continue to affect millions of users.

The report comes as the UK government’s voluntary Online Fraud Charter marks its first anniversary. The charter, signed by major tech companies, aimed to combat online fraud by introducing a series of protective measures, including the verification of new advertisers and the swift removal of fraudulent content. However, despite these commitments, the scale of the problem remains substantial, raising questions about the effectiveness of the current response.
According to Which?’s findings, the vast majority (63%) of scams occurred on social media platforms, with 42% of victims reporting fraud via search engines, 39% on online marketplaces, and 23% through messaging services. The most common platforms for scams were Facebook (37%), Google (33%), Instagram (20%), Amazon (18%), and WhatsApp (18%).
Which? surveyed over 2,000 UK adults to determine whether the charter has had an impact on the number of scams consumers encounter on online platforms and whether they feel safer online in the year since the initiative began.
Nearly 73% of UK adults expressed distrust in the ads they encounter on social media and search engines, while a third (34%) reported feeling less confident in using online platforms compared to a year ago. Only 3% said they felt more secure.

The continuing prevalence of scams has left consumers increasingly anxious, with 22% of respondents encountering suspicious ads or messages every day over the last six months.
Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: “For every week the government fails to take action, we lose millions to fraudsters and organised crime groups – taking money from productive firms, reducing overall levels of investment in the UK economy and damaging consumer confidence. The government and regulators need to act urgently to tackle the fraud epidemic or risk millions more falling victim to scammers.”
Story continues
The Online Safety Act, which is set to hold online platforms accountable for fraudulent advertising, will not be fully enforced until 2027. Concha argued that this timeline is far too slow, urging regulator Ofcom to implement regulations sooner and for a more coordinated approach across the tech, banking and telecom sectors to address the rising tide of scams.

A quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it’s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.
Its most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.
There’s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.

But when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains — a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period — weren’t what they used to be.
Nvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.
AI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.
“We are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,” Creative Strategies director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.
On the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they’re spending on AI hardware.

Nvidia’s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer’s Jacob Bourne.
Story Continues
“Critical questions around Blackwell’s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,” Bourne said in a note. “There’s little room for execution missteps in 2025.”
There is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump’s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs.
For the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%.
That said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter.
Of course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.

The bigger question is whether AI will transform computing over the long term or whether it’s just another investing trend. Does anyone remember the term ""Big Data""?

The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation.

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about earnings results from some of the top consumer and retail companies and said, as a compliment, that America has become a nation of “cheapskates” where consumers are unwilling to pay more when there’s little or no value.
“There’s something happening here, and what it is is exactly clear: we’ve become a nation of cheapskates. I say that as a compliment. Nobody gets away with charging too much anymore—not in this country, no matter the industry, perhaps even the drug industry. It’s happening now, it’s happening fast, and many companies are being left behind by the change. I see it everywhere I go—in the grocery store, online, in the mall, and, of course, in the stock market.”
Cramer talked about how restaurants that offer cheaper but quality meals are seeing a surge in their stock prices amid rising revenues. He also discussed how weight-loss drugs are impacting companies that sell alcohol products.
“American people are tired of paying up. They feel gou, they feel betrayed, they feel that the only thing about brand loyalty is that it isn’t worth a dime. They want a better deal. They’ll eagerly switch lifetime habits in order to save some money because prices are up so much that you feel like an idiot if you’re paying up.”

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 219
Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the latest bull case thesis on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson, who recommended the stock at the current levels. Cramer said he agrees with the analyst.
Story Continues
Michael Nathanson said the following about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) in a latest interview with CNBC:
“Meta, their core business is really getting the benefit of AI. You see it in their ad numbers; they’re accelerating. Their engagement is doing really, really well, so they definitely have momentum behind their business. And they’ve beat our numbers all year long.”
Despite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg’s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).
According to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta’s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the world’s largest social network, were up this quarter, due to impressive top-line growth of 22% year-over-year and solid forward guidance. Despite its large scale, Meta continues to outgrow the broader digital advertising industry, with better AI-driven content recommendations increasing engagement in products like Instagram Reels, and AI improving ad targeting and conversion rates. Our industry checks have continued to validate advertiser adoption and satisfaction, with improvements in Reels monetization, as well as strong adoption of Advantage+, Meta’s AI-driven service to allocate advertiser budgets across its content surfaces.
Overall, META ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's latest stock picks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241125,AAPL,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has been unloading shares of one of its biggest holdings, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), across several quarters.
The first quarter of 2024 saw Warren Buffett selling 115 million Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, about 13% of its stake. Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake stood at 790 million shares at the end of the first quarter. Based on Apple’s March 31 closing price, the company sold approximately $20 billion worth of Apple shares, likely spread across multiple transactions. Apple Inc.’s shares fell nearly 11% during the same period.
On top of the 115 million shares sold during Q1 2024, Buffett went on to unload another 390 million shares in the second quarter. The sales led to a boost in Berkshire Hathaway’s cash reserves to a record $277 billion, up 47% from the first quarter. Despite Apple’s slowing sales and a weak macroeconomic environment in China, the iPhone maker’s stock was up.
In the third quarter, Buffett’s company sold 100 million more Apple shares, leaving Berkshire with about $70 billion worth of stock. This reduced its stake in the iPhone maker to 300 million shares. Meanwhile, Apple’s shares rose more than 10% in the third quarter.
According to Warren Buffett, selling Apple stocks made sense as Buffett believes stocks are trading above their intrinsic value and capital gains taxes are also likely to rise. This makes it advantageous to realize gains at the current lower tax rate as Buffett is trying to lock in profits before potential tax hikes. Another reason for selling the shares is to reduce exposure since the stock had become a very large portion of its portfolio.
Despite Berkshire reducing its stake, Apple’s stock price increased from $192.53 at the end of 2023 to $233 by the end of the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a 15.8% YTD gain. This suggests strong market demand for Apple shares and investor confidence in the company. Moreover, the selling strategy employed by Berkshire not only allowed it to book substantial gains but also preserved the stock’s upward momentum. All in all, the company has effectively realized over $100 billion in profits from a seven-year investment, and there is confidence that Berkshire will reinvest the funds effectively over time.
Here is how Vltava Fund explained why Buffett was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“You probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire’s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett’s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire’s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.”

20241125,AAPL,"As the Biden administration attempts to hand out and adjust CHIPS & Science Act funding to chipmakers, what is the commentary from President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration around boosting domestic semiconductor production?
Notably, the US is reportedly cutting Intel's (INTC) $8.5 billion chipmaking grant to below $8 billion as officials try to balance that with the $3.5 billion grant the company was awarded from the Pentagon.
""It's worth remembering that it was the first Trump administration that devised the concept of trying to incentivize firms to build more in the US, the CHIPS act was first discussed in Congress under the Trump administration, the first investment of TSMC (TSM) — the Taiwanese company in Arizona — was announced under the first Trump administration,"" Tufts University professor of International History Christopher Miller tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton.
""And so I wouldn't be surprised to see some small changes to the program. Specific grants might be amended, but the basic framework of trying to use financial incentives to get more chips made domestically, that's an idea the first Trump administration more or less came up with.""

20241125,AAPL,"We recently published a list of 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.
Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.
“Just to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we’ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get—very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they’ve trained haven’t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, “There is no wall,” so maybe it’s not an issue—we’ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.”
However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.
“I think if you take a longer-term view—2 to 4 years—we’re still very confident we’ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn’t mean there won’t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we’ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.”

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could face a reduction in its prized gross margins if President-elect Trump imposes tariffs on Chinese imports, according to research firm Jefferies. However, there remain many uncertainties at this stage, the firm said.
Story Continues
Analyst Edison Lee, who holds a “Hold” rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), noted that the company was exempt from import tariffs during Trump’s first term from 2016 to 2020. Since then, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has taken steps to diversify its production outside of China, such as shifting some manufacturing to India. Despite these efforts, only about 10% of iPhones are produced outside of China. While it’s possible that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) could secure another exemption, Lee suggested that if it doesn’t, the impact on gross margins could be significant.
“[Our] analysis indicates AAPL’s [gross margins] could potentially be impacted by 3.0-6.7ppt, and our DCF value by ~5% to 10%, assuming no ASP/vol change,” Lee wrote in a note to clients.
Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
The largest relative detractors during the quarter were Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Airbnb, and Tesla (not owned). We added a new position in Apple during the period, which we discuss further in the following section. While Apple is a roughly average-sized position in Focus Growth, it is the largest holding in the Russell 1000 Growth Index, at over 12%, and the stock’s outperformance in the quarter weighed on relative results.

Carey highlights several noteworthy deals, particularly the redesigned 10th-generation iPad now available for around $280. However, she cautions consumers to be strategic, advising them to ensure they're getting products that are not too old because ""you're looking at longevity being the issue.""
Carey outlines attractive deals across multiple Apple product lines, including MacBooks, AirPod Pro 2's, and Apple Watches. Carey points out an especially appealing aspect of these promotions: many older models remain viable options — especially since new health-related features with these techs will still be usable on older models.

20241125,AAPL,"Based on an internal order, Reuters reported that the Competition Commission of India turned down Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) plea to halt an inquiry report alleging the corporation violated competition laws. This ruling helps facilitate the continuation of the antitrust lawsuit to against the American technology behemoth.
The Indian antitrust agency decided in July that Apple had engaged anti-competitive behavior by abusing its dominating position in the app stores market for iOS. Apple refuted the claims, claiming that Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Android system dominates the smartphone industry in India, hence Apple is a relatively smaller player there.
Following Apple's worries about the illegal sharing of its commercial secrets to Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which owns Tinder, the commission issued an unusual recall of its inquiry in August. The government generated fresh investigative reports following the recall.
Apple said in November that Indian non-profit Together We Fight Society (TWFS), the complainant in the case, had not followed instructions to verify the deletion of previous findings. According to the regulator's Nov. 13 internal decision, Apple asked for action against TWFS for non-compliance and aimed to stop the updated investigation report. The antitrust case is still in progress.

20241125,AAPL,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook joined more than 20 corporate leaders in discussions with China’s premier Monday, as global companies grapple with potential trade disruptions and economic uncertainty.

Cook, who’s visiting the country for at least the third time this year, joined top executives of global firms including Rio Tinto Plc, Corning Inc. and Charoen Pokphand Group in a meeting with Li Qiang, state media reported. Chinese corporate chiefs including the heads of Lenovo Group and ICBC also attended the event, which discussed supply chain and trade issues.
The meeting, in which about two dozen executives took part, marked the first high-level meeting between foreign corporations and a senior Beijing official since Donald Trump won a second four-year term. Companies worldwide are bracing for the president-elect’s threat to hike tariffs on Chinese goods.
The gathering of business leaders, which took place before a supply chain expo in Beijing starting Tuesday, was earlier reported by Bloomberg News.
It went on for over an hour and felt pretty scripted, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing a private event. Li, at one point, quoted Adam Smith’s view that the propensity to truck, barter and exchange was inherent in human nature, the people said.
Li also told the executives to send any feedback to him, saying he would take it seriously, one of the people said. The premier didn’t mention Trump or tariffs, another person said.
In a separate report by the official Xinhua News Agency, Li said Beijing is against decoupling and urged efforts to maintain the stability of the global supply chain. He also vowed to continue developing the Chinese economy.
Disruptions to trade are a source of concern especially for Apple, which makes the majority of its iPhones through Foxconn in the country and counts China as its biggest market after the US.
The Apple CEO was in the capital just last month, when he promised to keep investing in the country and also underscored its vital role in the iPhone maker’s global operations.
Cook on Monday made it a point to emphasize the importance of the Chinese supply chain during brief remarks carried by a social media account linked to state broadcaster China Central Television. “I value them very highly. We could not do what we do without them,” Cook said in response to a question about Apple’s Chinese partners.
Story Continues
Beijing this year has taken a more active role in encouraging foreign investment, as the economy remains mired in a post-Covid funk.
AmCham China — represented by President Michael Hart at the meeting with Li — said the discussions focused on opportunities to strengthen supply chain resilience and expand bilateral and multilateral engagement. This is the first time that AmCham China has met with a Chinese premier since May 2022.
Li last held a roundtable with foreign business executives ahead of the China International Import Expo in Shanghai earlier this month. Since Trump’s election victory, he has picked several China hawks for top posts in his new administration.
Also present at the meeting were Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont, Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. Chairman Matsumoto Masayoshi, Robin Zeng of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., and Li Dongsheng, the chairman of TCL Technology Group Corp.

20241125,AAPL,"We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.
On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.
Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.
First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.
Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.
Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.
Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

Oaktree Capital’s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos
In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.
Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.
Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.
On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.
The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

No. of Hedge Funds: 158
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a globally renowned technology giant, known for its iconic products such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch. The company’s ecosystem, including services like iCloud and Apple Music, has built a loyal customer base.
On October 31, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results ended September 28. The company reported a record-breaking quarter revenue, with revenue increasing 6% year over year to $94.9 billion. According to CEO Tim Cook, the strong revenue growth was driven by the success of the company’s latest product lineup, including the iPhone 16 series, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Cook also highlighted the company’s commitment to innovation, citing the recent release of Apple Intelligence features that prioritize user privacy and enhance the overall user experience.
On October 30, Apple introduced two new chips, the M4 Pro and M4 Max, which join the M4 to form the most advanced family of chips ever built for a personal computer. The M4 family of chips is designed to bring far more power-efficient performance and advanced capabilities to the Mac. All three chips are built using industry-leading, second-generation 3-nanometer technology, which improves performance and power efficiency.
In their third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):
“Alphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.”
Overall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

20241125,AAPL,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia said a $100 million investment proposal from Apple (AAPL) to build an accessory and component plant was not enough for the country to allow the tech giant to sell its latest iPhone model, its industry ministry said on Monday.

Indonesia in November banned sales of Apple's iPhone 16 after it failed to meet requirements that smartphones sold domestically should comprise at least 40% locally-made parts.
Indonesia has also banned the sale of Alphabet's Google Pixel phones over a similar lack of use of local components.
Indonesian authorities last week said Apple had put forward the investment proposal to lift the sales ban.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""We have done an assessment and this (proposal) has not met principles of fairness,"" Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita told a press conference, comparing the proposal to Apple's bigger investments in neighboring Vietnam and Thailand.
Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia, but has since 2018 set up application-developer academies, which Jakarta considers a way for the company to meet local content requirement for the sale of older iPhone models.
Companies usually increase the use of domestic components to meet such rules through partnerships with local suppliers or by sourcing parts domestically.
Agus said Apple had an outstanding investment commitment of $10 million it should have carried out before 2023. He also wanted Apple to commit to new investment until 2026.
The ministry would invite Apple to visit Indonesia to negotiate further, Agus said.

20241125,AAPL,"The mobile browser market in the UK is not working well for businesses and consumers and Apple and Google should be investigated further by the competition watchdog, an initial inquiry has said.
The Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) independent inquiry group carried out an in-depth assessment of the mobile browser markets, and has raised concerns about how Apple controls how mobile web browsers work on its devices.
The CMA opened its investigation after its own market study, published in 2021, found Apple and Google have an effective duopoly on mobile ecosystems, across operating systems, app stores and web browsers on mobile devices, which it said meant the two companies were in a position to effectively set the rules on how mobile browsers work on their respective devices.
The independent inquiry group’s initial inquiry found that Apple’s rules in this area restrict competitors from being able to deliver new and innovative features to consumers.
It said concerns had been raised by other browser providers, who said that they are unable to offer a full range of features because of how Apple’s iOS and App Store operate.
In addition, it said Apple and Google can manipulate how users are presented with choices about which web browser to use on their devices to make their own browsers the clearest or easiest option.
As a result, the group has recommended that the CMA prioritises investigating Apple and Google’s activities in mobile ecosystems under new digital markets competition rules coming into force next year.
Margot Daly, chairwoman of the CMA’s independent inquiry group, said: “Markets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers.
“Through our investigation, we have provisionally found that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK.
“The analysis set out in this report and a range of potential interventions considered to address the market issues identified by the group merits consideration by the CMA board under its new powers, which have been specifically designed for digital markets.
“Under those new powers, the CMA can consider the case for designating firms with strategic market status, taking account of the interplay between the specific markets that are the subject of this market investigation and Apple’s and Google’s wider mobile ecosystems.”
Elsewhere, the group had also looked at the mobile cloud gaming market in the UK, but found that there was no need for the CMA to intervene at this time.
Story continues
In response, Apple said: “Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.
“We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS.
“We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart.
“We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.”",0.9849378475525279,"[[ 0.11046392 -0.3710127  -0.58786124 ... -0.87411726 -0.8878707

20241125,AAPL,"Apple CEO Tim Cook turned up at a supply chain conference in Beijing on Monday, his third public appearance in China this year, as the executive courts the world's biggest smartphone market amid an iPhone sales slump and uncertainty around the local launch of the Apple Intelligence system.
Cook, seen in a short video clip published on Monday, said he valued Apple's Chinese partners ""very highly"". ""We could not do what we do without them,"" he said in response to a question from an online media outlet affiliated with state broadcaster China Central Television.
The executive appeared at the China International Supply Chain Expo, which is set to kick off on Tuesday. It was his first time attending the show, Cook told Ren Hongbin, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the event organiser.

Cook's latest trip to China reflects the importance of the market to Apple, even as the company moves to diversify its production chain away from the country to counter geopolitical risks.
Heated competition from domestic vendors has battered iPhone sales on the mainland. And while local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei Technologies spin-off Honor have already introduced artificial intelligence software to their handsets, Apple is still awaiting approval from Chinese regulators to launch its AI services.
Huawei is slated to debut on Tuesday its Mate 70 smartphone series, the successor to the Mate 60 series that surprised many with its 5G capability and advanced processor when it was launched last year. The official Huawei online store showed that over 3 million people had signed up for pre-orders of various Mate 70 models on Monday. Pre-orders only signal an intention to buy, without requiring a deposit.
Despite the worldwide popularity of its iPhone 16 Pro launched in September, Apple saw a sharp double-digit year-on-year decrease in smartphone sales in China during this year's Singles' Day, according to research firm Counterpoint. In contrast, sales of Huawei's handsets grew 7 per cent during the world's biggest online shopping event.

Apple's revenue in the 12 months ended September 28 fell 7.7 per cent year on year in the Greater China market, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, according to its latest financial report.
Amid the growing challenges, Cook in March went on a charm offensive in Shanghai, where he met local video game developers, a filmmaker and Wang Chuanfu, the billionaire founder of electric vehicle maker BYD. He also opened a new Apple store.
In October, Cook travelled to Beijing to meet top Chinese officials, including the head of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the minister of commerce. They discussed Apple's development in China, cyber and data security, and cloud services, according to official readouts.

20241125,AMZN,"We recently published a list of 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.
Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.
“Just to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we’ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get—very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they’ve trained haven’t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, “There is no wall,” so maybe it’s not an issue—we’ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.”
However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.
“I think if you take a longer-term view—2 to 4 years—we’re still very confident we’ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn’t mean there won’t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we’ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.”

Talking about Big Tech earnings in a latest program on CNBC, Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) earnings brought a “surprise” for him.
Story Continues
“Amazon was the real surprise to me, where eCommerce guidance was actually pretty strong even though you have one less weekend this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas for people to go shopping. That didn’t seem to matter. Business is really good for them.”
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) threw it out of the park with its latest quarterly results amid strong Cloud growth. Amazon Web Services has generated $27.5 billion in revenue, marking a 19% year-over-year increase. The segment’s operating income is expanding at nearly 2.5 times the rate of its revenue growth, boosting Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s overall operating income. At this pace, AWS is on track to deliver $110 billion in annualized revenue. If it maintains its ~20% growth rate, AWS could reach $125-130 billion in revenue in FY 2025.
For the ongoing quarter, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) expects revenue between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, implying growth of up to 11%. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 32.9, higher than the big tech average of 25.5. If Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) grows its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 25% annually over the next three years, it could achieve an EPS of around $9.25 by FY 2027 (up from an estimated $4.74 in FY 2024). Applying a 35x P/E ratio in line with Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) historical average suggests a fair stock value of over $300. The primary catalyst for this target would be AWS’s robust operating income growth.
Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“The largest absolute detractors were Alphabet, Airbnb, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon’s position as a notable detractor speaks more to the size of the position than the magnitude of the underperformance, as the company delivered a solid set of results during the quarter.
Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

20241125,AMZN,"We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.
With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.
Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.
Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that ""it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions."" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to ""prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.""
To prove that ""equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,"" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that ""market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House."" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.
Story Continues
The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.
Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank ""urges caution"" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.
Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'
Between then and now, the bank believes that ""generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage."" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms ""building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.""
While generative AI might be in the ""trough of disillusionment,"" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the ""overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032"" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.
Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.
However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.
According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is ""more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud."" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.
Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.
Our Methodology
To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant player in the eCommerce and cloud computing industries. As a result, its narrative is driven by consumer and enterprise spending. Consumer spending is important for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) since it enables the firm to generate adequate merchandise volume shipments to maintain margins. Similarly, high enterprise spending means that the company is able to generate revenue through its cloud computing business. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s sizable moats in these two key industries have enabled it to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from its $71 billion in cash and equivalents. In turn, the sizable resources have allowed Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to expand its presence in the AI industry through its partnership with Anthropic. The firm is also one of the leading players in custom chip development for data center workloads, and it is developing custom chips to help reduce reliance on NVIDIA's expensive GPUs. To sum it up, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s tailwinds depend on robust consumer spending, cost efficiencies in the retail business, and enterprise spending on AI and cloud products.

Booking Holdings reported impressive third-quarter 2024 results, wherein both earnings and revenues grew on year over year. Revenue growth was driven by growing leisure travel demand. Substantial improvement in booking was a major tailwind for BKNG.
Strong momentum across BKNG’s merchant and advertising, and other businesses contributed well to top-line growth. The growing alternative accommodation business was a tailwind for BKNG. Solid growth in rental car and airline ticket units was a positive. The uptick in booked room nights is contributing well to gross bookings’ growth.
Booking Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.6% and 19.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.4% over the last 30 days.

20241125,AMZN,"We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.
On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.
Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.
First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.
Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.
Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.
Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

Oaktree Capital’s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos
In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.
Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.
Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.
On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.
The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.
Our Methodology
To compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

20241125,AMZN,"As Black Friday approaches, many shoppers will be wondering if they can snag a bargain.
This particularly true for higher-end items such as laptops, TVs and smartwatches. These could be wise investments as it often pays to opt for reliable and well-known brands whose products may last longer than cheaper knock-offs, but not everyone can afford to buy them at their regular price.
The shopping event, which starts on 29 November, has become a spectacle in recent years, with most major retailers claiming to offer big discounts on a sometimes bewildering array of products.

Shoppers may be tempted to hold off on buying a product earlier in the year, so they can get a better deal on Black Friday. However, concerns are rife about scams, fraud and ""bargains"" that are anything but.
On the other hand, as financial expert Martin Lewis notes, price-tracking tools, such as Amazon (AMZN)'s Camel Camel Camel, can help take the guess work out of shopping on Black Friday to help you find genuinely great deals on items that you already had your eye on.
What do you think? Would you use Black Friday to invest in pricier tech or household products or just buy them throughout the year instead?

20241125,AMZN,"The artificial intelligence (AI) era is hitting its second stage, benefiting software and cloud providers, Wedbush analysts say. Wedbush managing director of equity research Scott Devitt joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to discuss the firm's expectations for the next stage of AI and which companies are positioned to gain.
Devitt outlines the three stages of the AI era as Wedbush sees it. ""The first part of the cycle, which was the semiconductors, making significant amounts of money as the cloud companies change their architecture to be able to perform in an AI world.""
The second stage is ""the application phase of the cycle, which should benefit software companies as well as the cloud providers. And then, phase three of this will ultimately be the consumer-facing companies figuring out how to use the technology in ways that actually can drive increased interactions with consumers.""
The analyst says the market will enter phase two in 2025, with software companies and cloud provider stocks expected to see gains. He adds that cybersecurity companies could also benefit as the technology evolves.

20241125,AMZN,"Amazon (AMZN, Financial) has upped its bet on Anthropic, an AI company, by pumping in another $4 billion, bringing the total amount invested to $8 billion. This investment will be made progressively through convertible notes, with $1.3 billion to be invested first. Amazon will also remain a minority investor in Anthropic, which announced the news on Friday. It also brings the expansion of their already deepening relationship closer, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) as Anthropic's primary training ally. AWS will support Anthropic's future AI solutions, while Amazon Trainium and Amazon Inferential chips will help improve training performance?
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.
This deal shows the growing interest of giants like Amazon in generative AI, similar to Microsoft's (MSFT, Financial) investment in the OpenAI project. As part of this partnership, AWS will also provide first access to Anthropic's custom fine-tuning features for AWS customers developing AI solutions.
The latest investment demonstrates the competitive race in AI, where organizations are partnering with key players to advance in AI. Anthropic has already incorporated its AI models into AWS's Bedrock service, and this further integration appears certain to supercharge the diffusion of advanced generative AI across industries.

20241125,AMZN,"Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) has rapidly ascended to become a dominant force in South Korea's e-commerce sector, often compared to the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of South Korea due to its customer-centric, logistics-driven approach. However, Coupang's operations go well beyond e-commerce; it has cultivated a full ecosystem of services that provide convenience and added value to its customers. In this article, we'll explore the company's model, recent growth strategies, and why it holds strong potential as an investment.
Building a Comprehensive Ecosystem
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with CPNG.
Coupang's business model revolves around its proprietary ""Rocket Delivery"" system, offering same-day and next-day delivery for orders received by midnight, with packages often delivered by 7 a.m. the following morning. This fast delivery is possible due to Coupang's extensive logistics network, which includes over 100 fulfillment centers across South Korea. The strategic placement of these centers allows Coupang to reach 70% of the South Korean population within a 7-mile radius. While the company has made significant investments in infrastructure, these investments create long-term competitive advantages. High entry barriers mean that any new entrant would face significant costs to replicate Coupang's logistics scale, and they would still have to win over Coupang's loyal customer base.
Coupang holds the highest market share in South Korea's e-commerce sector, effectively competing against both local and international players. Its commitment to rapid delivery, competitive pricing, and a diverse product selection has solidified its reputation as a leading online retailer.

Beyond e-commerce, Coupang's ecosystem includes a variety of offerings:
Rocket Fresh: A grocery delivery service that delivers by 7 a.m. if orders are placed before midnight.
Coupang Eats: A restaurant delivery service similar to Uber Eats.
Coupang Play: A subscription-based video streaming platform.
Coupang Pay: Coupang's fintech arm, providing digital payment solutions.
Rocket Wow: Similar to Amazon Prime, this paid subscription service includes perks like free and expedited delivery options, exclusive discounts, and access to Coupang Play content.
Another key feature, Rocket Direct Purchasing (also called ""Rocket Jikgu""), enables South Korean customers to purchase international products directly from countries like the United States, China, and Japan, with Coupang handling all logistics, customs, and delivery. Additionally, Coupang Flex provides flexible, part-time delivery opportunities known as Flexers, similar to DoorDash's (NASDAQ:DASH) drivers Dashers.

WOW Membership
WOW members increasingly recognize the value of their membership, which includes benefits such as free same-day and dawn delivery, free returns, exclusive content on Coupang Play, and discounted deliveries from Coupang Eats. This strategy has proven effective in increasing user engagement. For example, Coupang recently introduced a 5% to 10% discount on Eats orders for WOW members, resulting in a 90% increase in Eats orders by WOW members and more than doubling Eats' transaction volumes in many regions.
WOW members who use Eats also exhibit higher retention and engage more frequently across Coupang's ecosystem. This engagement translates into higher spending and cross-category purchasing, demonstrating the strength of Coupang's subscription-driven loyalty model.
Coupang's Entry into Luxury Fashion
In January 2024, Coupang acquired Farfetch Holdings plc, a leading global online luxury fashion platform, for $500 million. Farfetch, previously battling high debt and consistent losses, had established itself as a significant player in luxury fashion but struggled with profitability and logistical challenges in a highly competitive space.
Coupang views the acquisition as an opportunity to tap into the rapidly growing global personal luxury goods market, valued at around $400 billion. With this acquisition, Coupang can leverage its advanced logistics infrastructure to make high-end fashion more accessible and improve delivery standards for luxury goods, particularly in South Korea, where consumers are among the world's highest per capita spenders on luxury items. This acquisition provides Coupang with a unique positioning, combining speed and premium service for luxury shopping.
Looking forward, Coupang plans to stabilize Farfetch's operations through the end of the year and explore potential synergies between the two companies in 2025. This integration could unlock new revenue streams and operational efficiencies, further strengthening Coupang's long-term growth prospects.
Expansion into Taiwan
Beyond South Korea, Coupang has been selectively expanding internationally. In June 2021, Coupang began operations in Japan, aiming to replicate its South Korean success. However, the company faced stiff competition from established players like Amazon and Rakuten and ultimately ceased operations in March 2023.
Around the same time, Coupang also launched in Taiwan, where its signature ""Rocket Delivery"" service quickly gained popularity. By November 2023, Coupang had opened a second fulfillment center in Taoyuan City. Taiwan has been a success story, with Coupang's app becoming one of the most downloaded shopping apps in the region. Coupang's experience and learnings from South Korea have allowed Rocket Delivery to scale even faster in Taiwan. Management is leveraging advanced technology and processes developed over the years that enable Coupang to reach profitability in Taiwan faster than in Korea.
Financials
In the most recent quarter, Coupang's revenue grew 32% year-over-year (YoY) in currency-neutral terms, or 25% excluding Farfetch. This marks the 14th quarter out of the past 15 that Coupang has achieved at least 20% constant currency growth. Gross margin expanded by 350 basis points margin expansion in gross margin though a rise in general and administrative expenses from investments in automation, technology, and infrastructure kept the operating margin flat YoY. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $343 million, a 44% increase YoY, or $345 million excluding Farfetch.
Product commerce revenue increased by 20% YoY, reaching $6.9 billion, with an adjusted margin of 6.8%, up 10 bps from the previous year. Coupang's active customer base reached 22.5 million, driven by deeper engagement within existing customer segments and the expansion into new categories like Fresh and Fulfillment and Logistics by Coupang (FLC). Long-term growth is expected to be supported not only by these newer offerings but also by increasing spending from both existing and new customer cohorts, all of which saw notable spending growth this quarter.
Developing offerings increase 347% YoY to $975 million. This segment includes services such as its signature ""Rocket Delivery"" to new customers in Taiwan, Coupang Eats, Coupang Play, Fintech Services and Farfetch Integration. Despite the strong revenue growth, Developing Offerings maintained negative margins, with an adjusted margin of -13% (representing a $127 million loss). While still in its growth phase, this segment is crucial to Coupang's diversification strategy and future growth.
Farfetch alone contributed $439 million in revenue this quarter. Initially, Coupang aimed for near break-even profitability for Farfetch by the end of the year, but CFO Gaurav Anand recently noted that Farfetch is nearing break-even earlier than expected. For now, Coupang is focused on stabilizing Farfetch, with plans to assess and pursue synergies between Coupang and Farfetch in 2025.
Although cash flows dipped slightly, this was not primarily due to Farfetch. Operating cash flow declined 54% YoY to $334 million, while free cash flow came in at -$42 million. Coupang attributed this drop mainly to one-time working capital benefits from the previous year. Over the past four quarters, Coupang has generated over $800 million in free cash flow, more than half of what it generated in the prior period. The company maintains a healthy balance sheet with over $5.8 billion in cash and $1.6 billion in debt.
Risks
While Coupang's growth story is impressive, several risks could impact its trajectory. In June 2024, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission fined Coupang 140 billion won (approximately $102 million) for allegedly manipulating search algorithms to favor its private-label products. This regulatory scrutiny could lead to increased compliance costs and require operational adjustments to align with fair trade practices.
The integration of Farfetch and international expansion add complexities around operational alignment and synergies. Coupang's experience in Japan, where it ceased operations due to strong competition, highlights the difficulties in expanding internationally. While I like how management acknowledged the error and ceased operations and despite Taiwan's expansion appears more promising, the challenges of replicating its South Korean model in different markets require ongoing adaptation and monitoring.
Valuation
Coupang: The Amazon of South Korea Expands Its Reach
Source: Author
As Coupang works toward consistent profitability, traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) metrics are not yet applicable. However, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, currently at 1.61x, is lower than that of peer companies like Amazon and Alibaba. This discount reflects Coupang's smaller size and earlier stage of maturity compared to its peers. Nonetheless, for growth-focused investors, Coupang's projected revenue growth rate of over 20% for the next two years is an attractive proposition.
Coupang: The Amazon of South Korea Expands Its Reach
Lastly, using a discounted cash flow analysis, combining a multiples-based approach and a perpetuity growth model, I estimate Coupang's intrinsic value to be around $35 per share, suggesting a potential 40% upside from current levels.

My Final Take
Coupang's rise in the e-commerce sector reflects its innovative logistics, customer-centric strategy, and expansion efforts beyond its core market. The Farfetch acquisition shows the optionality of Coupang and exemplifies the company's ambition to diversify its revenue streams, while the expansion in Taiwan highlights Coupang's adaptability and learning curve after the challenges faced in Japan. Given its growth potential, valuation, and strong positioning in South Korea and Taiwan, I believe Coupang has the potential to be a market-beater in the coming years.

Entrepreneurship in the United States has been surging since the pandemic and AI trends have served to bolster this phenomenon. Technology startups associated with AI have reached valuations in the tens of billions. Underpinning this situation is the rise in small businesses.

However, the number of accountants needed to balance the books at these startups is diminishing.

20241125,AMZN,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – November 25, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Nvidia’s NVDA and Amazon AMZN.
Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture
Nvidia’s quarterly results were excellent, with the chip giant not only beating estimates and raising guidance but also achieving top- and bottom-line growth rates that are typically associated with start-up players.
Nvidia’s Q3 earnings increased +106.3% from the year-earlier period to $19.37 billion while revenues were up +93.6% year-over-year to +35.08 billion.
To get a sense of the market’s lukewarm reaction to these otherwise impressive results from Nvidia, take a look at the chart below that plots the stock price relative to how estimates consensus EPS estimates have evolved over time.
The chart's light blue and red lines represent the evolution of consensus EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025, respectively. The steepness of those lines shows how persistent the favorable revisions trend has been, with analysts seemingly struggling to catch up with how strong underlying business trends have been for Nvidia.
Nvidia’s stock market momentum has made its market capitalization the highest of the Magnificent 7 group at $3.59 trillion, surpassing Apple at $3.45 trillion and Microsoft at $3.07 trillion. Investors’ lukewarm reaction suggests that they have become used to getting far bigger guidance upgrades than what they received this time around. Nvidia’s upgraded guidance is solid, but relatively underwhelming by the company’s own standards.
We don’t want to come across as making too big of a deal of the stock’s reaction to the quarterly results. After all, Nvidia shares are up +191.3% over the past year and have handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (up +32.5%), the S&P 500 index (up +30.4%), and the Mag 7 group (up +20.6%).
Beyond Nvidia, the focus lately has been on the Retail sector, with several major conventional operators coming out with quarterly results. Through Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 29 of the 34 Retail sector companies in the S&P 500 index.
Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.
The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players.
Story Continues
Total Q3 earnings for these 29 retailers that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 58.6% beating EPS estimates and only 51.7% beating revenue estimates.
Members of the Zacks Retail sector have struggled to beat estimates in Q3, with the trend particularly notable on the EPS beats front that are tracking below the 20-quarter low at this stage.
Concerning the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 24 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q3 earnings were up +71.6% on +11% higher revenues, as it beat EPS and top-line expectations.
As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is now a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.
Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard
Through Friday, November 22nd, we have seen Q3 results from 476 S&P 500 members, or 92.2% of the index’s total membership. We have another 8 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this holiday-shortened week, including Dell, HP, Best Buy, and others.
Total earnings for these 476 companies that have reported are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 73.7% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates.
The proportion of these 476 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51.1%.
The comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.
One significant drag on the aggregate growth pace has been the Energy sector, whose Q3 earnings were down -22.9% from the same period last year on -2.7% lower revenues. Q3 earnings for the index would be up +10.6% on +6.3% higher revenues had it not been for this Energy sector drag. The growth trend appears stable-to-positive, though fewer companies are beating consensus estimates relative to other recent periods. In fact, both the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below the 20-quarter averages.
The Earnings Big Picture
Looking at Q3 as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +8.1% from the same period last year on +5.7% higher revenues.
The Energy and Tech sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q3 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector pushing it higher.
Had it not been for the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be up +10.6% instead of +8.1%. Excluding the Tech sector’s substantial contribution, Q3 earnings growth for the rest of the index would be up only +2.9% instead of +8.1%.
Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 group, Q3 earnings for the rest of the 493 S&P 500 members would be up only +2.4% instead of +8.1%.
For the last quarter of the year (2024 Q4), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +7.7% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues.
Unlike the unusually high magnitude of estimate cuts that we had seen ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, estimates for Q4 are holding up a lot better.
Please note that this year’s +7.9% earnings growth improves to +9.9% on an ex-Energy basis.

20241125,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Netflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.
Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Netflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

20241125,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX, Financial) Live sports and events kept NFLX in focus as Bank of America (NEOE: BOFA, Financial) increased its price target to $1,000 from $800. The firm cited the Tyson-Paul boxing match, which surpassed 60 million viewers worldwide, as a pivotal example of how live content is reshaping the streaming giant's growth trajectory.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with ORCL.
Based on new agreements such as exclusive NFL game streams this Christmas and a Beyonce concert, Netflix is becoming a major contender in live streaming. Economists at the Bank of America estimate this shift could add between $500 million and $1 billion annually to revenue. Concentrating on live sports and other kinds of targeting advertising is expected to enhance viewers' involvement and increase the participation of premium advertisers.?
Netflix is currently trading near $897, and because of its diversification, it has a comparative advantage over most of its competitors. Some analysts are still cautious about giving dangerous signals about the Traditional' streaming business model. This ambitious streaming giant keeps differentiating itself from the rest through its steady investment in original content and new verticals.

20241125,NFLX,"Netflix stock (NFLX) closed at a fresh record every day this past week, with shares securing their biggest weekly gain since January — and they could keep soaring.
A growing number of analysts are calling for the streaming giant's shares to soon trade in the quadruple digits.
On Wednesday, Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak raised his price target on Netflix to a Street high of $1,100 a share, implying over 20% upside based on current trading levels of around $900.
Bank of America's Jessica Reif Ehrlich followed one day later, boosting her target to $1,000 from $800. Jefferies analyst James Heaney also raised his target to $1,000 earlier this week.
The price target increases come despite some concerns over slowing growth for the streaming giant.

Wall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $800 a share, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.
One of the main catalysts for the recent price target boosts is the company's continued foray into live events, with the most recent boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson attracting over 108 million global viewers last weekend to become the most-streamed sporting event of all time.
For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers.
The Netflix event's impressive numbers came despite the streamer experiencing several technical glitches throughout the broadcast, which analysts (and investors) mostly shrugged off.
""We view the event as a (very) successful learning experience for NFLX and expect these technical issues will not happen again with future live events,"" Pivotal Research's Wlodarczak wrote on Wednesday.
The analyst said the event's success likely means Netflix will ""accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming,"" which will help lower subscriber churn and increase the streamer's ability to raise prices.
""The NFLX service remains a highly compelling, frankly relatively inexpensive, entertainment alternative for consumers, which bodes well for future subscriber/average revenue per user growth,"" he said.
Netflix's 'complementary growth drivers'

Since the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged roughly 85%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.
Story Continues
Last week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.
Netflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyoncé will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.
The company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Jefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a ""breakthrough"" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.
BofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, ""Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.""
Netflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.
Still, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.
""With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.
Valuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock ""is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025."" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Netflix shares were on track for a fifth consecutive gain on Friday and set for their biggest weekly percentage rise since January, after the streaming media company's popular boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul.
The stock was last up 0.2% at $899.06, off its intraday record high of $908 on Thursday. It has risen every session since the Nov. 15 fight, taking the stock up more than 9% for the week.
Several brokerages this week raised their price targets on the stock, including BofA Global Research, which on Thursday bumped up its price target to $1,000 from $800.
Netflix said on Tuesday that 108 million people worldwide watched the match between Paul, a 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prize-fighter, and the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Tyson. The event, which Paul won, was streamed live on Netflix.

20241125,NFLX,"Netflix Boxing Battle Decided In The Ring, But Paul's $16M Mansion Takes The Real Estate Crown
Jake Paul was victorious in Friday’s highly anticipated Netflix boxing match against Mike Tyson and his real estate portfolio seems to outshine the boxing legend’s holdings too.

The 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer won unanimously and bought a $16 million compound that dwarfs Tyson's Nevada residence.

Paul's recently acquired estate in Dorado, Puerto Rico, shows the social media star's success outside the ring. The eight-bedroom, eight-bathroom compound underwent $2.1 million in renovations after its 2023 purchase.

In a recent YouTube tour titled “My new $20,000,000 house tour,” Paul highlighted his changes, including a redesigned entrance for improved energy flow.
According to Realtor.com, the property includes several distinctive amenities, such as a 40-person hot tub and dedicated office space for Paul’s content production team. His garage also received a custom makeover to accommodate his growing car collection.
By comparison, Tyson's real estate footprint appears modest.

The former heavyweight champion's current residence, a $2.5 million mansion in Henderson, Nevada, has appreciated to an estimated $4.7 million, according to Realtor.com. The 8,000-square-foot home, where he lives with his wife, Lakiha Spicer and their children, has six bedrooms and six bathrooms.
Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.
According to the report, Tyson's real estate history includes a previous 19,500-square-foot estate in Southington, Ohio, which he sold for $1.3 million during financial difficulties in the late 1990s.

The 58-acre property's subsequent owner never occupied it, serving time in prison for money laundering.
The record-breaking boxing match, which earned Paul roughly $40 million and Tyson $20 million, further widens the wealth gap between the two fighters. According to CBS News, Paul said he wanted to fight again after the victory, targeting a championship title within two years. ""I truly believe in my skills, my ability and my power,"" he said, setting his sights on the cruiserweight division.

20241125,NFLX,"Think about the last time you listened to music on Spotify, watched a movie on Netflix, hailed a ride on Uber, or ordered food via DoorDash. These companies have millions of digital customers—and billions of interactions with them. They are using the insights from this data to rapidly optimize each customer’s next experience.
In the age of artificial intelligence, competitive advantage is increasingly determined by a company's ability to deliver personalized experiences at scale. We call this phenomenon the “personalization advantage,” which can be expressed by a simple formula:
P = n × v2
P represents the competitive advantage of personalization.
N is the volume of interactions from which the company can learn.
V is the speed of learning, which has an exponential impact.
The Personalization Advantage formula illustrates why these companies are winning: they have both scale (n) in terms of customer interactions and speed (v) in learning from and acting on these interactions.
Personalization is not just customization—it’s about using customer data to deliver experiences tailored in real-time, evolving with each interaction. Whether it's a website suggesting products you didn't know you needed based on prior behavior, a call center agent knowing your shopping history with the company, or a sales associate remembering your preferences, the key is scaling these interactions across millions of customers and constantly learning from them.
Personalization is creating experiences at scale that get fine-tuned with each successive interaction, empowering customers to get what they want better, faster, cheaper, or more easily. The difference lies in the way personalized communications build on everything the company learns about the customer over time, and about how other customers like them behave. In our experience across industries and consumer contexts, this is what makes personalization truly effective. This effectiveness is directly linked to the Personalization Advantage formula. The more interactions a company has (n), and the faster it can learn from them (v), the greater its personalization advantage (P) becomes.
It is enabled by the many different forms of AI available: machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and others, often combined together. Business is now effectively at the point where competitive advantage will be based on a company’s ability to relentlessly capture, analyze, and utilize customer data, at a massive scale, with every possible contact—and on how it uses that data to understand, shape, personalize, and optimize each customer’s journey.
Story Continues
Building economies of scale has always been important in business, especially in the physical aspects of competition: supply chains, production, and distribution. However, personalization changes the nature of scale in the customer experience from the mass production of goods to the mass delivery of 1:1 experiences built on accumulated intelligence. Personalization at scale, and the ongoing cycle of experimentation and learning that power it, create a competitive moat that is very hard to replicate. This competitive moat is precisely what our Personalization Advantage formula quantifies.
It’s about scale (n)
Companies such as Alipay, Amazon, Tencent, Flipkart, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify have each amassed over 200 million active users. The sheer size of their digital customer base is enormous. They distill insights about these users not just when they transact, but every time they browse or click in a digital channel. But even non-digital native companies are maximizing the “surface area” they have for gathering and using customer information—like an alarm company understanding how homeowners use their touchpads or B2B distributors tracking the frequency and nature of replenishment orders.
These companies even know the lifetime value of each new active user they add—and invest accordingly. For example, a large food and beverage company we’ve worked with estimated that each 10 million new digital customer relationships would add $1 billion in incremental revenue.
It’s about speed (v)
Ultimately, personalization is about what companies do with the insights about their customers. This is where companies are competing on speed. Speed in getting to know the customer throughout the customer journey, speed in executing based on a trigger about a customer, and speed in constantly improving the experience based on that knowledge. We are big believers in the importance of “time-based competition,” the concept of competing on the basis of speed. In personalization, it is foundational.
The squared term in our formula (v2) emphasizes the outsized impact of speed. Doubling the speed of learning and execution more than doubles the personalization advantage.
It is no coincidence that companies across a wide swath of categories, including home improvement, banking, restaurants, grocery, and apparel have publicly announced that personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences are central to their corporate strategy. These companies understand that maximizing both (n) and (v) in the Personalization Advantage formula is crucial for their success.
By studying hundreds of personalization leaders over the past decade, we have even quantified the size of the personalization advantage pioneering companies are capturing in terms of growth. Across industries, we find that personalization leaders consistently outgrow laggards. In fact, leaders grow top-line revenues 10 points faster per year than laggards. Taken together, we estimate that by the end of this decade, the personalization leaders, on a combined basis, will capture almost $2 trillion in incremental growth.
The basis of competition has shifted—and the prize for those that rethink their business model accordingly is enormous. But here’s the catch. Our research also finds that only 10% of companies qualify as personalization leaders. Many businesses say they are doing personalization but fail to go beyond basic segmented marketing. They end up sending more spam, generating more calls from complaining customers, and frustrating themselves with slower growth than expected. These laggards are failing to optimize both (n) and (v) in the personalization advantage formula, limiting their growth potential.

As reported by South China Morning Post, China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen met with Nvidia's executive vice president of worldwide field operation responsible for NVIDIA's global business, Jay Puri, on Monday, November 25th. Puri’s meeting highlighted China’s importance as a key market for Nvidia. Meanwhile, Minister Wang Shouwen highlighted opportunities for foreign businesses in an open China, welcoming Nvidia to deepen its ties within the country, according to a statement.
Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Slips Amid Growing Geopolitical and Market Pressure
The meeting comes ahead of an expected escalation of US restrictions on China’s semiconductor industry, which could be announced early this week. It is anticipated that the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden will soon impose another round of export restrictions on China, with new regulations potentially adding up to 200 Chinese chip companies to a trade blacklist, Reuters reports. Moreover, it is expected that further US curbs on shipments of high-bandwidth memory chips to China will be unveiled next month.
It seems that investors are pricing in these risks, with the news adding to market uncertainty. Amid these risks, the challenge for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) now lies in living up to the market’s sky-high expectations.  Wall Street expects a 54% revenue growth for Nvidia in 2025.  While it is true that the demand for Nvidia’s chips continues to gain momentum, minor setbacks or uncertainties can prove detrimental to the stock due to such expectations.
If the pressure on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) wasn’t already enough, the chip stock is also competing with Apple for the title of the world’s most valuable company. With market capitalizations of about $3.5 trillion each, the stakes are high in meeting market expectations.
Our research director shared his views on NVDA’s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241125,NVDA,"We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.
With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.
Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.
Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that ""it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions."" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to ""prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.""
To prove that ""equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,"" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that ""market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House."" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.
Story Continues
The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.
Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank ""urges caution"" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.
Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'
Between then and now, the bank believes that ""generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage."" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms ""building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.""
While generative AI might be in the ""trough of disillusionment,"" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the ""overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032"" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.
Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.
However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.
According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is ""more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud."" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.
Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.
Our Methodology
To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 30%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world-leading GPU designer whose products are powering the artificial intelligence industry. Since the release of ChatGPT to the public, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have gained 730%, making it clear that AI is baked into the firm's hypothesis. The firm's fortunes depend on its ability to not only design the best-performing chips but also to sustainably and predictably ship them in high volumes to customers while keeping margins high. Consequently, any turbulence on either the product design, shipping, or cost control fronts leads to tailwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares. Additionally, the high demand for its chips has meant that big tech is eager to find alternatives. The urgency for alternatives is also making companies design in-house AI chips, such as those from Amazon. As a result, unless NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) maintains its performance edge and logistics capabilities, the firm might see trouble in the future.
Polen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
""In a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market’s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock’s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (“GenAI”) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.”
Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Joel Shulman, Founder, CEO, and CIO at ERShares, about investing in entrepreneurial companies, both public and private.
Private assets have experienced rapid growth in recent years, and the largest asset managers are racing to bring them to retail investors. However, private assets are inherently illiquid and difficult to value, making it challenging to package them into an ETF wrapper that offers intraday liquidity and transparent pricing.
OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, recently saw its valuation rise to $157 billion, up from $80 billion earlier this year and $29 billion in 2023. The startup’s latest funding round was oversubscribed, with participation from Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, SoftBank, and others.
SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has seen its valuation soar to $180 billion. Like other high-profile startups, it has chosen to remain private as institutional investors continue to pour money into these markets.
The Entrepreneur Private-Public Crossover ETF XOVR is the first crossover ETF designed to enable investors to invest directly and indirectly in both public and private equity securities.
The fund changed its ticker and strategy in August but remains focused on entrepreneurial companies. It will limit its private equity investments to 15%. AppLovin APP, NVIDIA, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META are its top holdings currently.
Given the inherent illiquidity and valuation challenges of private assets, how will this ETF invest in private companies?

20241125,NVDA,"Nvidia (NVDA) has developed a new kind of artificial intelligence model that can create sound effects, change the way a person sounds, and generate music using natural language prompts. Called Fugatto, or Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1, the model is a research project. Nvidia says it’s not announcing any plans to release the technology, but it could have broad implications for industries ranging from music and entertainment to translation services.
“The thing that's so exciting about [Fugatto] is that having a model that you can prompt to ask it to make sounds in certain ways really opens up the landscape of things that you can imagine doing with it,” Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at Nvidia, told Yahoo Finance.
Shares of Nvidia fell 4% on the day.
What sets Fugatto apart from other models, Catanzaro explained, is that it can perform the tasks of several other models. For instance, there are models that can synthesize speech and others that can add sound effects to music; Fugatto, however, does it all. Think of it as a kind of complement to video- and image-generating models like Stability AI’s Stable Video Diffusion or OpenAI’s Sora.
“The foundational improvement here is that … we're able to synthesize audio using language, and that, I think, opens up new prospects for tools that people can use to create amazing audio,” Catanzaro added.
According to Nvidia, Fugatto is the first foundational model with emergent properties, which means it’s able to mix the elements it’s been trained on and follow “free-form instructions.”

The model can generate audio via standard word prompts as well as manipulate audio files that you upload. So if you have a file of a person speaking, you could translate that person’s words to another language while still making it sound like their voice. You could also take a simple tune and make it sound like an orchestral performance or add different beats to music.
You can also upload a document and have the model read it in any voice you’d like. What’s more, you can tell the model to produce voices that carry emotional weight. Want audio of a dejected English teacher reading Edgar Allen Poe? Fugatto should be able to do it.

Catanzaro, however, warns that the model isn’t always perfect. And some results are better than others.
Like generative image and video models, Fugatto raises questions about the potential impact on artists, sound engineers, and people in related fields. Catanzaro, though, says he hopes the technology helps musicians.

""I hope what it means is new tools for artists to explore,” he explained. “I think audio has always been a fruitful place for exploration. You know, when we get new tools for audio, sometimes we get new forms of music.”

That’s certainly true. The guitar gave rise to blues and rock, while turntables helped birth hip-hop as we know it today. The entertainment industry, however, has a rocky relationship with AI.
The Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA fought Hollywood studios over fears that the studios would use AI to cut writing jobs or replicate actors’ and actresses’ likenesses. The labor unions reached deals with the studios last year to limit the use of the technology.

20241125,NVDA,"As the Biden administration attempts to hand out and adjust CHIPS & Science Act funding to chipmakers, what is the commentary from President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration around boosting domestic semiconductor production?
Notably, the US is reportedly cutting Intel's (INTC) $8.5 billion chipmaking grant to below $8 billion as officials try to balance that with the $3.5 billion grant the company was awarded from the Pentagon.
""It's worth remembering that it was the first Trump administration that devised the concept of trying to incentivize firms to build more in the US, the CHIPS act was first discussed in Congress under the Trump administration, the first investment of TSMC (TSM) — the Taiwanese company in Arizona — was announced under the first Trump administration,"" Tufts University professor of International History Christopher Miller tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton.
""And so I wouldn't be surprised to see some small changes to the program. Specific grants might be amended, but the basic framework of trying to use financial incentives to get more chips made domestically, that's an idea the first Trump administration more or less came up with.""

20241125,NVDA,"We recently published a list of 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.
Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.
“Just to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we’ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get—very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they’ve trained haven’t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, “There is no wall,” so maybe it’s not an issue—we’ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.”
However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.
“I think if you take a longer-term view—2 to 4 years—we’re still very confident we’ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn’t mean there won’t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we’ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.”

Mark Yusko, Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO & CIO, is recommending investors sell Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Yusko explained his bear thesis on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) during a program on CNBC:
Story Continues
“I’m old enough to remember that Intel stock went up 20 fold over 10 years because their chip was going to revolutionize AI in 2000 and today that stock is 63% lower than it was 24 years ago. So you don’t stay on top forever and Nvidia came along and invented GPU and now we got TPUs and VPUs and LPUs. So I think innovation will keep rolling but the thing I’m most worried about with Nvidia, their third largest customer is about to get delisted. That’s a big story.”
Asked how Super Micro (SMCI) delisting could impact Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the analyst said:
“Well if it’s your third largest customer and they actually haven’t, they don’t have the capacity to continue to be your third largest customer, what happens to your revenue growth and profits growth? I, you know, we’ve seen this movie before with Nell and Cisco back in 2020. So I don’t know, that makes me nervous.”
Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for Nvidia anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia’s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. Nvidia’s biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers — which account for 50% of its revenue — are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia’s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins.
Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“In a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market’s heightened volatility.

20241125,NVDA,"We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.
On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.
Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.
First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.
Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.
Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.
Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

Oaktree Capital’s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos
In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.
Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.
Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.
On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.
The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.

Our Methodology
To compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)
No. of Hedge Funds: 193
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in graphics processing technology, powering innovations in gaming, AI, data centers, and autonomous vehicles. The company’s GPUs are the gold standard for performance in applications requiring high computational power.
NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) journey from a gaming-centric GPU manufacturer to a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) market has culminated in its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI). On November 6, the company was added to the DJI, replacing Intel. This milestone, combined with the upcoming launch of its highly anticipated Blackwell processors, positions the company for sustained growth.
The imminent release of NVIDIA’s Blackwell processors is poised to further solidify the company’s dominance in the AI chip market. The Blackwell GPUs are in high demand among companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta, which are constructing AI data centers to support their offerings. Priced between $30,000 and $40,000 each, these GPUs are already being delivered to data centers and industrial clients for AI applications, with consumer availability expected in 2025. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Jensen Huang stated, “Blackwell is in full production and demand for Blackwell is insane,” emphasizing, “Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.”
Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241125,NVDA,"NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock fell nearly 4% Monday, plummeting to a three-week low as investors continued to shift their focus towards cyclical stocks, coinciding with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a new high.
Nvidia attempted to maintain an upward trend that began in August, according to technical charts, but shares failed to hold above the support level of the June 20 reversal high, which was near $141.
Nvidia stock is now approaching a potential support zone, ranging from the July 11 reversal high near $136 to the 50-day moving average close to $134.
A one-day Demark indicator, which is often used to identify potential price exhaustion and the likelihood of an impending price reversal, showed a reading of 13 at 12:45 p.m. This reading can suggest that a trend may be overextended and could be due for a reversal.
Despite the day's losses, Nvidia's stock performance has been notable over a longer period, with the stock having risen 187% this year up to the last close, and an impressive 197% increase over the past 12 months.

20241125,NVDA,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.
That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.
However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Nvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 72.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 123.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -28.1%.
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 2.2%.

Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.9% over the past month.
Bottom Line
Nvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

20241125,MSFT,"We recently published a list of 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.
Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.
“Just to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we’ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get—very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they’ve trained haven’t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, “There is no wall,” so maybe it’s not an issue—we’ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.”
However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.
“I think if you take a longer-term view—2 to 4 years—we’re still very confident we’ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn’t mean there won’t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we’ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.”

Dan Niles: Microsoft (MSFT) Should ‘Worry’ You

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279
Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, in a recent program on CNBC discussed Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and said the stock should “worry” you amid declining Cloud growth and valuation.
Story Continues
“The one that should worry you is Microsoft, and the reason I say that is we’ve all heard of OpenAI and ChatGPT, which really kicked all this off at the end of calendar 2022. Obviously, Microsoft has a huge stake in OpenAI. But if you look at the numbers for Microsoft, their June quarter Azure, which is their cloud business, was growing 35%. Then that went to 34% in the September quarter, and they guided to 31% to 32%. So the numbers are going down. If you look at Amazon, their cloud business has actually accelerated over the last five quarters, from 12% to 19% growth. They’re the biggest. And if you look at Google, which is the smallest of them, their growth accelerated from 29% last quarter to 35% in the quarter they just reported. So you’ve got to ask yourself: is Microsoft actually getting a return for all this money that they’re investing?”
Niles said Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) P/E of 33 is also higher than the market’s 24 and that should also concern investors.
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell after the company reported its latest quarterly results. Analysts believe most of the revenue beat came from PC segment, while investors were paying more attention to AI and Azure. Azure’s 34% growth met expectations, though guidance for next quarter fell short, projecting between 31% and 32% growth—1 percentage point below forecasts. This dip is attributed to delays in data center capacity from third-party providers, though Azure’s consumption trends remained steady.
Investors hoping for a rebound in IT spending were likely disappointed, as stable Azure consumption suggests no significant uptick in the second half of the year. In addition, the lower-than-expected Q2 guidance underscored tempered growth expectations.
AI services, however, contributed a robust 12 points to Azure’s growth, a steady continuation from the previous quarter. Microsoft’s management confirmed strong demand for AI services, although supply constraints are limiting further expansion. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) anticipates AI-related revenues, including M365 Copilot and Azure AI, could reach $10 billion annually by next quarter—making it one of the fastest-growing segments in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s history.
Carillon Eagle Growth & Income Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) traded lower following concerns about the sustainability of its data center buildout for generative artificial intelligence (AI). The company continues to show strong growth in its cloud segment, and management highlighted optimism surrounding demand signals.”
Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), the heavyweight of Big Tech, has hit a grim milestone in technical analysis: a Death Cross.
With its share price slipping below key moving averages, MSFT stock has moved into bearish territory, casting doubts on its near-term prospects. Is this just a blip for the software giant, or the prelude to deeper woes?
Chart created using Benzinga Pro
MSFT Stock: Bearish Signals All Around
At $418.19, MSFT stock price trails its 20-day, 50-day and even the 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). Technical indicators are sounding alarms:
The 20-day SMA at $418.73, the 50-day SMA at $421.65 and the 200-day SMA at $421.81 all point to a bearish signal.
The eight-day SMA at $417.37, continues to be driven by bullish sentiment over the short term, driven by buying pressure.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stands at -1.11, another red flag.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 49.09 suggests that Microsoft isn't oversold yet but is heading toward bearish momentum.
These technical markers paint a strongly bearish picture. Yet, buying pressure persists, indicating that investors still see potential for a turnaround—a glimmer of bullish hope amidst the gloom.

The ProPublica Bombshell
Compounding Microsoft's technical woes is a ProPublica investigation that has raised ethical and legal concerns over the company’s federal contracting practices. As detailed in the report, Microsoft's ""White House Offer""—a supposedly altruistic pledge to bolster government cybersecurity—was a calculated business maneuver.
The plan involved providing free upgrades and consulting services to federal agencies, locking them into Microsoft's ecosystem. Once the ""free"" period ended, agencies had little choice but to continue with costly subscriptions and Azure services, effectively squeezing out competitors.
This strategy not only strengthened Microsoft's grip on federal business but also invited scrutiny for potentially violating federal procurement and antitrust laws. Legal experts argue that the deal sidesteps open competition, raising concerns about its long-term implications for government reliance on a single vendor.
A Double-Edged Sword
While the technical indicators signal bearishness, the buying pressure suggests a tug-of-war between short-term skepticism and long-term optimism. Microsoft's market dominance—bolstered by its lucrative cloud business and strategic maneuvers—remains a formidable moat.
Story Continues
However, the ethical controversies surrounding its federal contracts could dent investor confidence and invite regulatory headwinds.
The Verdict
Microsoft's Death Cross is a wake-up call for investors. With the stock under technical pressure and the ProPublica revelations casting a shadow over its business practices, the path forward is murky.
Bulls might see this as a chance to buy on weakness, banking on Microsoft's resilience. Bears, however, have a compelling case to remain cautious as the stock navigates this precarious juncture.
For now, Microsoft's crossroads is a reminder that even the mightiest of tech giants are not immune to scrutiny—or the market's harsh judgment.

On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.
Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.
First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.
Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.
Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.
Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

Oaktree Capital’s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos
In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.
Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.

On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.

In social media posts and comments on platforms like outage tracker Downdetector, some impacted said that they were having trouble seeing their emails, loading calendars or opening other Microsoft 365 applications such as Powerpoint.
Microsoft acknowledged “an issue impacting users attempting to access Exchange Online or functionality within Microsoft Teams calendar” earlier in the day. In updates posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, the company's status page said it identified a “recent change” that it believed to be behind the problem — and was working to revert it.
Microsoft shared that it was deploying a fix — which, as of shortly before noon ET, it said had reached about 98% of “affected environments.” Still, the company later noted that targeted restarts were taking slower than expected for the majority of affected users.
“We’re facing delays in our recovery efforts and are taking immediate action to address them,” Microsoft 365 status wrote on X Monday afternoon. “We understand the significant impact of this event to your businesses and are working to provide relief as soon as possible.”
Data on Downdetector showed thousands of outage reports from users of Microsoft 365, particularly Outlook. Reports appeared to peak around noon ET Monday, but have fallen some since.

Entrepreneurship in the United States has been surging since the pandemic and AI trends have served to bolster this phenomenon. Technology startups associated with AI have reached valuations in the tens of billions. Underpinning this situation is the rise in small businesses. According to the US Department of Treasury, an average of 430,000 new business applications were submitted monthly in 2024 — a 50% increase from 2019. However, the number of accountants needed to balance the books at these startups is diminishing. Per a report by tech news platform TechCrunch, nearly 75% of CPAs are projected to retire within a decade, and fewer graduates are pursuing accounting due to higher-paying opportunities in tech and finance.

20241125,MSFT,"Elon Musk’s go-to legal strategy for the many lawsuits he and his sprawling business empire have filed over the years can be summed up in a few words: Spend and intimidate opponents into submission.
The billionaire uses his deep pockets to drag out cases until his adversaries run low on money, legal experts say. Or he uses the courts to punish critics and instill fear in anyone merely considering speaking out against him.
In the past month alone, Musk’s companies have filed two new lawsuits against California state officials. One, by SpaceX, alleges the state’s coastal commission retaliated against Musk for his support of Donald Trump by blocking the space cargo company from launching more of its rockets. Another lawsuit by his social media service X, formerly Twitter, takes aim at a new state law that requires it to police its service for election-related deepfake videos, or videos created with the help of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, Musk also filed his third in a succession of complaints against OpenAI, the buzzy company behind the ChatGPT chatbot that he cofounded but with which he later had a falling-out. In this updated version, he roped OpenAI investor Microsoft into the case, accusing the tech giant of violating antitrust law with its multibillion-dollar investment in the AI startup.
Most of the suits Musk files target threats to his companies. In his eyes, litigation is just a cost of doing business that’s built into what he charges customers, says Joan MacLeod Heminway, a University of Tennessee law professor who in August published a paper about Musk’s litigiousness, titled Representing Elon Musk.
“He really just sees litigation as part of his business model in some ways,” Heminway says.
Musk’s legal tactics are similar to those of some other wealthy and litigious plaintiffs, notes Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. They put high-priced law firms on speed dial, deliberately file cases in friendly courts, and are more than happy to attack small defendants like nonprofits, even if they may not win.
“The point is to pressure people to do what you want them to do,” says Barrett, adding that the tactic requires a “certain shamelessness.”
Musk and several of his outside attorneys did not respond to requests for comment nor did representatives from X and SpaceX.
Musk’s new best friend, President-elect Trump, is also known for starting aggressive and lengthy legal battles. Recently, Trump’s lawyer sent letters to publishers about unflattering reporting, demanding $10 billion in damages from the New York Times and Penguin Random House for “false and defamatory statements.” Leading up to the election, Trump threatened government force and legal action against a variety of enemies, from critical journalists to former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). But as is typical with his threats, Trump didn’t carry through.
Story Continues
In Musk’s case, part of his legal strategy is to move his businesses from California to places like Texas, which have lighter regulations and more sympathetic judges. Earlier this year, he announced that X and SpaceX would move their headquarters from California to near Austin, citing his opposition to a California law supporting LGBTQ+ youth in schools. He’s also changed X’s terms of service in a way that may help protect it from lawsuits. As of Nov. 15, any X users who want to file their own lawsuits against the social media company must do so in Texas, either in federal court or state court, where judges are considered to be more pro-business.
Another big part of Musk’s modus operandi is to hire expensive lawyers who aren’t afraid to take on more “creative” cases, as Heminway put it. Some of his lawsuits involve legal gymnastics that are untested in court, but he can easily afford to plow ahead anyway when others would think twice about spending the money, she said.
“He's not afraid to hire people who will reach into areas of law to try and find things that he needs, to either defend against or to bring cases against others,” Heminway notes.
In one case targeting the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), for example, X accused the nonprofit of illegally scraping user data from X to inform its report that criticized Musk’s decision to reinstate users who had previously been banned for misbehavior on the service. A federal judge rejected X’s claim and dismissed the case, saying it was merely an effort to silence critics, known in legal circles as a SLAPP.
“X Corp. has brought this case in order to punish CCDH for CCDH publications that criticized X Corp.—and perhaps in order to dissuade others who might wish to engage in such criticism,” Federal Judge Charles Breyer wrote in his ruling. X has appealed the case.
X filed a similar lawsuit in Texas against Media Matters for America over its report that the platform displayed hateful content alongside digital ads from major companies, including Disney. While similar to the CCDH fight, Federal Judge Reed O’Connor didn’t dismiss the case in an August order, finding instead that X “has properly pled its claims.”
Musk also likes to drag out litigation. Like many moneyed plaintiffs, he’s willing to outspend his opponents and squeeze them into settling. As one lawyer who is currently litigating against Musk puts it, “By definition, he has the deepest pockets that any litigant will ever have.”
Using the grind to his advantage
The legal experts suggest that the tech billionaire’s goal isn’t necessarily to win in court: Instead, as the attorney put it, “He wants people to be afraid to criticize him.”
The attorney, who asked not to be named in order to protect client identities amid ongoing litigation, summed up Musk’s strategy as, “‘I have more resources than you do, so I’m going to use those resources to make everything into a grind.’”
The tactic has yielded results: After an appeal, X blocked at least part of a California law that required companies to police content on their services. Musk himself in August ended his lengthy custody battle against Grimes, his former partner with whom he has three children and who has previously said she was “going bankrupt” amid the ongoing litigation.
Taking on regulation
Musk’s latest litigation challenges a new California law, AB 2655, that targets AI-generated deepfakes in deceptive election content. California Gov. Gavin Newsom promised to take action in July in response to Musk retweeting a post that used a deepfake of Vice President Kamala Harris talking about how she’s unqualified to be president.
In its filings, X argued the new law is overly broad and chills political speech. The law requires social media platforms to remove and block “materially deceptive” content related to elections and candidates during campaigning, and to set up ways for users to label and report deepfakes.
“It is difficult to imagine a statute more in conflict with core First Amendment principles,” lawyers for X wrote in its complaint.
This year, X scored a partial win by blocking a different California measure that would have required social media companies to disclose their policies about hate speech and content moderation. The social media company’s effort, based on a First Amendment argument, was initially denied by a federal judge. But an appeals court later sided with X, ruling that requiring social media companies to report their enforcement efforts to the government was likely unconstitutional. The lower court will decide whether other facets of the law can still be enforced.
SpaceX also in October took on the California Coastal Commission, accusing it of political discrimination after it blocked Musk’s company from continuing to launch rockets from a military base on the state’s central coast. The company’s complaint alleges that the vote “was not based on concerns about impacts to coastal resources, but instead on the political views held by SpaceX’s largest shareholder and CEO, Elon Musk.”
Unfriendly competition
Musk, a cofounder and now competitor of OpenAI, with his xAI startup, has also gone to court to accuse ChatGPT company’s CEO Sam Altman and president Greg Brockman of prioritizing profits over its purported interest in benefiting humanity.
Musk’s claims against OpenAI have grown over the past year; the first iteration of the lawsuit was filed in California state court in February. He dropped the lawsuit in June then refiled in federal court in August.
Microsoft was added to a third version of the lawsuit, with Musk now leveling antitrust claims related to the tech giant’s multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI. More broadly, the Federal Trade Commission and other regulators are examining the outsize role of Big Tech firms in AI investment and innovation.
According to Musk’s latest complaint: “OpenAI, Inc., co-founded by Musk as an independent charity committed to safety and transparency—and nurtured in its infancy by Musk’s money, advice, recruiting efforts and connections—is, at the direction of Altman, Brockman, and Microsoft, fast becoming a fully for-profit subsidiary of Microsoft.”
Musk’s X also brought antitrust claims in August against the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), member companies, and its backer, the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), an ad industry trade group. X argued the defendants acted as a cartel by discouraging members from advertising on its service over concerns about brand safety standards. Three days after the lawsuit was filed, WFA shut down GARM, citing the litigation’s strain on resources. The case is still ongoing, however. And on Thursday, the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched an investigation into WFA citing similar antitrust claims.
Of course, Musk and his companies also must fend off a torrent of lawsuits from others. He’s had mixed results there.
Tesla settled a discrimination lawsuit over how the business treats Black employees, for example. And earlier this year, just before going to trial, the company settled a five-year-old wrongful death lawsuit over a fatal crash involving its car’s Autopilot technology. Still, the EV company faces at least half-a-dozen more, on top of federal traffic safety investigations.
In other cases, Musk’s lawyers have prevailed. Musk’s tweets, alone, are a huge source of litigation based on his controversial statements online. They include cases brought by the National Labor Relations Board over anti-union comments, crypto investors accusing Musk of insider trading, and a British caver Musk described as a “pedo guy.”
No matter who initiates the litigation, Musk is for certain one thing: a gold mine to the legal industry. His lengthy track record of suing and being sued, along with his companies, is keeping armies of attorneys employed across the country.

News agency Reuters recently reported that the rise of artificial intelligence is reshaping investment strategies, driving massive capital demands that challenge traditional tech-sector dynamics. Unlike previous tech booms focused on software, the current AI wave is heavily centered on hardware, which is significantly more capital-intensive. Per the report, big tech companies are projected to spend over $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 nearly double the levels of 2021. These investments primarily target AI infrastructure, from data centers to advanced chips.

The report contends that the shift to hardware-oriented AI development introduces long-term financial risks. AI infrastructure projects often have extended timelines before profitability, making them vulnerable to economic slowdowns, inflation, and geopolitical factors. AI startups, too, face challenges. Their capital-intensive models rely on large funding rounds, with 2024 seeing nearly half of US venture capital allocated to AI. However, per Reuters, economic downturns or high capital costs could restrict funding availability, slowing innovation and reducing demand for AI hardware. Additionally, hardware businesses face cyclical risks, including inventory fluctuations and delayed scalability.

The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion.

20241125,MSFT,"In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary.
But the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments.
Nancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023.
The timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit.
Well, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices.
And now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s.
As this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions.
Nancy Pelosi as Investment Guru?
Let's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024.
Maybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer.
Gurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list.
Her most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price.
On the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece.
Story Continues
If our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption.
And after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July.
And look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price!
Meanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025.
Looking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies.
Unlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too.
But other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way. What do you think?

With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.
Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.
Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that ""it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions."" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to ""prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.""
To prove that ""equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,"" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that ""market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House."" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.

The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.
Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank ""urges caution"" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.
Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'
Between then and now, the bank believes that ""generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage."" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms ""building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.""
While generative AI might be in the ""trough of disillusionment,"" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the ""overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032"" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.
Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.
However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.
According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is ""more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud."" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.
Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)
Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 32%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity products and services provider whose Falcon system was at the heart of one of the biggest IT outages earlier this year. Its shares are down 9% since the blackout and have gained 53% since the post-outage bottom. The recovery in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s stock is based on shifting investor attitudes about the firm's subscription revenue and legal implications stemming from the outage. As few legal troubles and customer switching surface, investors are slowly creeping back to CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s stock. However, the firm is continuing to face pressure from Delta Airlines because of the outage as the two companies have sued each other. Apart from the implications of the outage, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s $10 billion recurring revenue guidance for 2031 and a midpoint free cash flow margin guidance of 36% will continue to drive its margin due to the central role that the metrics play in any software company's hypothesis.
Baron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.”
Overall CRWD ranks 4th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Levine said that while customer turnover is still a concern, the recorded influence has been negligible so far; however, it might influence price. ""Our research confirms that pricing concessions are being offered across the board, and it appears that most customers are taking advantage of it,"" Levine said.
He pointed out that while the company's ""Customer Commitment"" packagewhich comprises discounts and free productsaims to retain and draw in consumers but might strain cash flow, yearly recurring income, and general revenue.

As CrowdStrike approaches its third-quarter earnings announcement, let’s see if it is the right time to invest in this stock.
Factors Influencing CrowdStrike’s Q3 Results
CrowdStrike’s third-quarter results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD’s products in the fiscal third quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.
Stellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the third-quarter top line. The increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Subscription revenues is pegged at $936.6 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 27.7%. However, revenues from the Professional Services segment are likely to decrease 6.7% year over year to $49 million in the third quarter.
CrowdStrike’s collaboration with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products’ availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon’s AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.
However, the July 19 global IT outage incident is likely to have negatively impacted sales growth in the third quarter. During its second-quarter earnings call, CrowdStrike stated that it expects to see an extended sales cycle with additional scrutiny requiring higher management-level approval for new deals by some organizations due to the global IT outage incident.

Elevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are also likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal third-quarter bottom line.

Investment Thesis for CRWD Stock
CrowdStrike stock has made a remarkable comeback following the significant dip in its share price triggered by the global IT outage on July 19. The company has adopted proactive measures following the incident, including the rollout of new automated recovery techniques and enhancements to the Falcon platform. This effort included bolstering content visibility and control, improved quality assurance and an external review to strengthen platform security. Such strategic moves are essential to restoring and maintaining customer trust, a critical factor in retaining market leadership.
The Falcon platform’s comprehensive range, spanning more than 28 modules that include endpoint protection, identity security and next-gen SIEM, ensures a diversified growth path. CrowdStrike’s cloud security, identity protection and LogScale SIEM businesses collectively surpassed $1 billion in ARR in the second quarter, growing more than 85% year over year. This diversified portfolio positions the company well to withstand industry volatility and adapt to evolving client needs.
CrowdStrike’s strategic positioning in the cybersecurity landscape is evidenced by its continuous partnerships and customer endorsements. Even after the incident, significant deals were secured, demonstrating that clients still view CrowdStrike as a trusted partner for security solutions. Notable wins included a nine-figure contract in the cloud security domain and multiple eight-figure deals, underscoring the firm’s strong sales pipeline and growth potential.
Moreover, the company's “Falcon Flex” subscription model, which simplifies module adoption and supports customer expansion, has become a cornerstone for driving higher customer retention. This model allows enterprises to scale their cybersecurity needs without procurement friction, supporting long-term engagement and revenue growth.
Despite these upsides, CrowdStrike is not immune to headwinds. The global IT outage incident has imposed short-term pressures, including extending sales cycles and shifting certain deals into upcoming quarters. The company’s third-quarter guidance reflects caution, with expectations of muted upsell activity and temporarily elevated contract durations impacting net new ARR. Management’s projection that these challenges will subside over a year implies near-term fluctuations but signals a return to growth by fiscal 2026.
Conclusion: Hold CRWD Stock for Now
While CrowdStrike’s recent surge is impressive, and the long-term growth outlook remains compelling, holding the stock is a wise choice for now. The company’s history of strong quarterly performance, innovative strategies and strong customer relationships underscore its resilience. However, given near-term operational challenges and the potential for extended sales cycles, maintaining a hold position allows investors to benefit from long-term gains while weathering any short-term volatility.
CrowdStrike’s fundamental strengths position it as a cybersecurity leader, making it a stock worth holding as it navigates the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. CRWD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241125,CRWD,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News and Ratings Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks.
News agency Reuters recently reported that the rise of artificial intelligence is reshaping investment strategies, driving massive capital demands that challenge traditional tech-sector dynamics. Unlike previous tech booms focused on software, the current AI wave is heavily centered on hardware, which is significantly more capital-intensive. Per the report, big tech companies are projected to spend over $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 nearly double the levels of 2021. These investments primarily target AI infrastructure, from data centers to advanced chips.
Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.
The report contends that the shift to hardware-oriented AI development introduces long-term financial risks. AI infrastructure projects often have extended timelines before profitability, making them vulnerable to economic slowdowns, inflation, and geopolitical factors. AI startups, too, face challenges. Their capital-intensive models rely on large funding rounds, with 2024 seeing nearly half of US venture capital allocated to AI.

20241125,CRWD,"Earnings To Watch: CrowdStrike (CRWD) Reports Q3 Results Tomorrow
Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) will be reporting results tomorrow after the bell. Here’s what you need to know.
CrowdStrike beat analysts’ revenue expectations by 0.6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $963.9 million, up 31.7% year on year. The quarter itself was solid, with ARR (annual recurring revenue), revenue, and operating profit all beating. Guidance was underwhelming, though, as full-year revenue was lowered and revenue guidance for next quarter missed Wall Street’s estimates.
Is CrowdStrike a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it’s free.
This quarter, analysts are expecting CrowdStrike’s revenue to grow 25.1% year on year to $983.1 million, slowing from the 35.3% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.81 per share.
CrowdStrike Total Revenue
Analysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. CrowdStrike has a history of exceeding Wall Street’s expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 1.3% on average.
Looking at CrowdStrike’s peers in the cybersecurity segment, some have already reported their Q3 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Varonis delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 21.1%, beating analysts’ expectations by 4.7%, and Qualys reported revenues up 8.4%, topping estimates by 2.1%. Varonis traded down 10.7% following the results while Qualys was up 23.9%.

CrowdStrike is up 23.6% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $339.07 (compared to the current share price of $372.48).

Entrepreneurship in the United States has been surging since the pandemic and AI trends have served to bolster this phenomenon. Technology startups associated with AI have reached valuations in the tens of billions. Underpinning this situation is the rise in small businesses. According to the US Department of Treasury, an average of 430,000 new business applications were submitted monthly in 2024 — a 50% increase from 2019. However, the number of accountants needed to balance the books at these startups is diminishing. Per a report by tech news platform TechCrunch, nearly 75% of CPAs are projected to retire within a decade, and fewer graduates are pursuing accounting due to higher-paying opportunities in tech and finance.

David Phillips, a serial entrepreneur, has addressed this gap through his venture Fondo. Fondo uses AI, software, and accounting experts to offer a subscription-based bookkeeping platform tailored to startups and small businesses. The platform has already gained traction, securing 1,200 customers, achieving $6 million in annual recurring revenue, and becoming profitable. It recently closed a $7 million seed funding round led by Tokyo-based Money Forward, with investors like Y Combinator and Motley Fool Ventures. The round values Fondo at $66 million.

Latest reports from tech news platform TechCrunch indicate that MatX, a chip-design startup focused on supporting large language models, has raised $80 million in a funding round. This follows the $25 million seed round it held less than a year ago. The latest round, led by Spark Capital, values the company at a pre-money valuation in the mid-$200 million range and a post-money valuation in the low $300 million range, per TechCrunch. MatX was co-founded two years ago by former Google TPU team members Mike Gunter and Reiner Pope, who aim to address the global shortage of AI-specific chips.

20241125,AVGO,"We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.
On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.
Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.
First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.
Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.
Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.
Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

Oaktree Capital’s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos
In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.
Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.
Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.
On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.
The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

20241125,AVGO,"While Nvidia (NVDA) continues dominating the AI chip market, investors seek additional opportunities in the rapidly evolving sector. Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations.
Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry.
Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options.
Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: ""It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software — and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.""

Chicago, IL – November 22, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of Stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Merck & Co., Inc. MRK, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM and Natural Health Trends Corp. NHTC.
Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:
Top Analyst Reports for Broadcom, Merck and Qualcomm
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Broadcom’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company’s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.
However, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom’s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.
(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)
Merck’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.
Yet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.
(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)
Shares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.
Story Continues
Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.
However, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space. The company formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions.
(You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)
Shares of Natural Health Trends have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+1.8% vs. +21.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, a declining active member base remains the biggest concern for the company. It faces liquidity challenges and high operating expenses. Dependency on key markets and intense competition pose additional risks.
However, expansion into new markets and improvement in cost management bode well.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC). These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

Broadcom’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company’s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.
However, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom’s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.

Merck’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.
Yet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.
(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)
Shares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.
Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.
However, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space. The company formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions.

Shares of Natural Health Trends have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+1.8% vs. +21.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, a declining active member base remains the biggest concern for the company. It faces liquidity challenges and high operating expenses. Dependency on key markets and intense competition pose additional risks.
However, expansion into new markets and improvement in cost management bode well.

20241125,AVGO,"Investor confidence in certain major companies has propelled markets higher, but there are also those betting against big-name stocks through short selling amid continued uncertainty.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly topped the 6,000-point mark in the recent rally following Donald Trump's election win, though they have since eased back, with the main US index closing Wednesday's session flat at 5,917.
While markets broadly rose following the US election, there were a particular group of stocks that rallied in what has been dubbed the ""Trump trade"", around expectations as to the policies that the Republican president-elect could look to implement after he returns to the White House in January.
One of which was Tesla (TSLA), as the electric carmaker's CEO Elon Musk was a major supporter of Trump's campaign and has since been nominated by the president-elect to co-lead the recently announced Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
Read more: FTSE 100 winners and losers following Trump's US election win
The post-election rally in Tesla stock pushed its market valuation to over the $1tn mark, which was welcome news for investors that are bullish about the company's prospects.
However, not all investors were reaping the benefits, as data from S3 Partners showed that short-sellers had lost nearly $8bn by the Monday after the election, according to Business Insider.
Unlike the traditional way of investing in markets by buying shares with the goal of selling them at a higher price, also known as going ""long"", short selling aims to make a profit on the declining price of the stock. An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.
The hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.
And while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.
Analysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in the last month.
Here are the major companies that have become popular shorts.
Popular short stocks
S3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.
Story continues
Chipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.
The demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.
At the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.
Shares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.
And Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.

The discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.
Tesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.
However, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve ""slight growth"" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.
S3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).
Following its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.
S&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this ""may be related to the [US] election"".
They said that despite this significant activity in ""all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses"".
Global short bets
Meanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.
The data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on ""crowdedness"", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors’ supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.
LVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.
The company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an ""uncertain economic and geopolitical environment"" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.

The luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.
Kering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.
Shares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.
Multinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.
Diageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.
It has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.
In South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.
Read more: What we know about planned UK private stock market Pisces
Hindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were ""nothing but a lie"".
On Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.
Shares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.
In a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were ""baseless"".
Hindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.
However, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.

20241125,AVGO,"The Computer and Technology group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Computer and Technology peers, we might be able to answer that question.
Broadcom Inc. is a member of our Computer and Technology group, which includes 619 different companies and currently sits at #2 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Broadcom Inc. is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO's full-year earnings has moved 5% higher within the past quarter. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.
According to our latest data, AVGO has moved about 46.3% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, the Computer and Technology sector has returned an average of 28.4% on a year-to-date basis. This shows that Broadcom Inc. is outperforming its peers so far this year.
One other Computer and Technology stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is American Superconductor (AMSC). The stock is up 179.7% year-to-date.
The consensus estimate for American Superconductor's current year EPS has increased 117.7% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
Breaking things down more, Broadcom Inc. is a member of the Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which includes 44 individual companies and currently sits at #146 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has gained an average of 42.8% so far this year, so AVGO is performing better in this area.
In contrast, American Superconductor falls under the Electronics - Miscellaneous Components industry. Currently, this industry has 28 stocks and is ranked #52. Since the beginning of the year, the industry has moved +7.6%.
Broadcom Inc. and American Superconductor could continue their solid performance, so investors interested in Computer and Technology stocks should continue to pay close attention to these stocks.

20241125,AVGO,"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?
When Is Debt A Problem?
Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.
Check out our latest analysis for Broadcom
How Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?
The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.
NasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024
How Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?
We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.
Of course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.
In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).
Story Continues
Broadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.
Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.
Our View
When it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.
When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt. Readers can access a list of growth stocks with zero net debt 100% free, right now.

As NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market—and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO).
What To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry.
Broadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers—critical components for Nvidia’s AI-focused operations.
Don’t Miss:
Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.
This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.
A strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.
Historically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia’s during major market reactions. Nvidia’s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.
How To Buy AVGO Stock
By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.
Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.
If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

Economic data releases and earnings
Chip stocks are down 3% since the election. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure.
Once the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months.
Nvidia (NVDA) earnings — coming after the bell Wednesday — will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally.

Tom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday.
""It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,"" said Essaye. ""It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print.""
Nvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock — up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years — hit record highs following the election.
But many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year.
Semiconductor returns during the second half of 2024
The worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far.
Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor — is down 14%.
The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous.

To be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday.
""Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],"" said Essaye.
Since the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia — ""priced to perfection"" according to many analysts — underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning.

20241125,AVGO,"We recently compiled a list of the Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against Harvard University's other stock picks.
When it comes to college prestige, Ivy League institutions lead the rankings. For an investment that can approach $60,000 per year in tuition and fees as of the 2022-2023 academic year, these schools promise an elite education and promising career prospects post-graduation. Although opinions may vary on which Ivy League school offers the best education, there’s no debate over which has the largest endowment. Harvard University’s endowment stands at an impressive $53.2 billion, bolstered by generous donations and strategic investments managed by the Harvard Management Company (HMC).
Founded in 1974, Harvard Management Company provides a dedicated funding stream that supports the university’s teaching and research, contributing over one-third of Harvard’s annual operating budget. In fiscal year 2024, Harvard’s endowment distributions totaled $2.4 billion, representing 37% of the university’s annual revenue. These funds supported key areas such as financial aid, faculty, and research initiatives. The university allocated $749 million toward financial aid across its schools, including $250 million for undergraduates. Harvard’s endowment portfolio is heavily weighted toward private equity and hedge funds, with private equity comprising 39% of the portfolio and hedge funds making up 32%.
According to Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, the endowment targets an 8% return, and its seven-year annualized return of 9.3% has exceeded that goal. This performance currently places it mid-tier among Ivy League and other elite institutions. While its fiscal year 2024 return did not match Columbia’s 11.5% or Brown’s 11.3%, it outpaced those of MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, and the University of Pennsylvania. Despite fiscal year 2024 being a strong period for public equities, with the S&P 500 frequently hitting record highs, Narvekar states that HMC’s strategy of lower public equity exposure still delivered robust returns:
“In FY24, public equity and hedge fund portfolios stood out for their strong performance. This is a particularly positive indicator, since HMC’s hedge fund portfolio has less equity exposure than most hedge fund indices, yet still outperformed during a strong year for equities.”
Notably, HMC significantly reduced the endowment's exposure to real estate and natural resources, scaling it down from 25% in 2018 to just 6% in fiscal year 2024. This strategic shift has contributed positively to the endowment's overall returns. Large-cap technology equities, particularly in the IT sector, may have also boosted returns for the fund. Michael Markov, founder of Markov Processes International, suggested that Harvard likely benefitted from ""overweighting IT and the Mag 7 relative to the broad S&P 500."" Markov considers fiscal year 2024 a success for Harvard and a testament to HMC CEO Narvekar’s strategy of overhauling the university’s complex portfolio during his seven-year tenure.

Our Methodology
For this analysis, we examined Harvard Management Company’s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Harvard Management Company's Stake: $89.6 million
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the world’s largest technology companies, with operations spanning the hardware and software sectors. The company’s primary strength is in hardware, as it supplies networking and custom chips across diverse applications.
In its third quarter, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $13.1 billion in revenue, a 47% year-over-year increase driven by strong AI revenue, VMware bookings, and robust non-AI semiconductor sales. Looking ahead to Q4 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expects AI revenue to grow 10% sequentially, reaching $3.5 billion, which would bring the annual AI revenue to $12 billion, largely fueled by ethernet networking and custom AI accelerators for data centers.
On November 6, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), projecting strong AI revenue growth with a CAGR of 30-35% in the coming years due to the company’s leadership in AI computing and networking and its strong free cash flow. However, BofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 earnings forecast for the company, citing “seasonal headwinds” linked to a product transition for Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which may impact early-year revenue. This effect is expected to be offset by new AI and networking contracts, along with increased content opportunities with Apple, potentially leading to an adjusted EPS of $7.31 by 2026.
Overall AVGO ranks 7th on Harvard University's list of top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

As the “AI arms race” continues to evolve, countries are increasingly beginning to realize the efforts they need to expend to stay relevant. One such country in the picture that’s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.

The remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do ""everything they can to lock their digital doors"" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.
""While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it"".
McFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.
In other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.
The search, which started on November 1st took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it “cannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs’ copied articles were used to build [OpenAI’s] models”.

“News plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week’s worth of its experts’ and lawyers’ work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today”.
OpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78
ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.
On November 25, Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained a “Buy” rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and a $1,150.00 price target. Key factors noted during a recent investor meeting have led to this buy rating. A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities. Another factor adding to the positive outlook is the disciplined approach to Pro Plus (the company's new generative AI SKU) pricing. The pressure on the Subscription Gross Margin in the coming year has already been factored into the analysis.
Overall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

20241125,NOW,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.
In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.
However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Our proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.
Story Continues
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.
Bottom Line
ServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

20241125,NOW,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.
View our latest analysis for ServiceNow
What's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?
ServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.
Can we expect growth from ServiceNow?
NYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

20241125,NOW,"ServiceNow stock (NOW) has been on a roll recently, boasting over 55% one-year returns, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500. While many are still bullish on further upside in the stock, we believe it's time to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the profits.
ServiceNow specializes in digital workflow automation, providing cloud-based workflow automation solutions that help organizations improve their operations. Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.
The company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.
Hard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage
The rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.
Approximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.
Some of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.
Our bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft’s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.
Carahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn’t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company’s future relations with the government.
In a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.
This also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn’t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock’s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.

20241125,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Shaping Wall Street Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.
In recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.
""We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously”
Helberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.

This news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a “wall”. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI’s Orion is “so far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI’s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.”
However, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is “no wall”. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it’s possible to have reached a turning point.
“We haven’t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we’ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.”
Gary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:
“The economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense…”
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

20241125,NOW,"ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
ROE can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:
14% = US$1.3b ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.
What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
ServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE
To start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.
NYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.
Story Continues
Is ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?
ServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Conclusion
On the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

20241125,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:
“When it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.”
READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks
Cramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.
Another sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.
While some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.
Similarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they’re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.
As for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they’ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.

“We need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we’re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.”

Cramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.’s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:
“Let's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive… Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market… Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting… Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again… Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.

Additionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company’s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.
Overall NOW ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

Sovereign AI: a new concept gaining traction in the realm of artificial intelligence. As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing “sovereign” artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to “codify” a country’s culture, history, and collective intelligence.

That said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent’s competitiveness and technological resilience.
Filippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they “understand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.”
“As this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.”
While AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.
Latest Advancements in AI
In recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon’s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe’s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world’s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.
“WoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification”.

Other fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.
In other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed “Operator”, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. The planned release is part of a wider industry movement towards agents—AI software capable of performing multi-step tasks for users with minimal oversight.

20241125,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.
Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday’s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there’s a catch.
“What if the Treasury doesn’t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.”
READ ALSO Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks and Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins
Even though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.
Cramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump’s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board—on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains—no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it’s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:
“If it’s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses… It has always worked for the stock market.”
But Cramer warned that there’s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market’s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.
Story Continues
“If you believe we’re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.”

How ServiceNow Inc (NOW)’s AI Partnerships Are Driving Its Soaring Growth: Insights from Jim Cramer
A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.
ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)
Talking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:
“As is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn’t make a lot of sense and… we’re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company’s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia’s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.
This partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.
For the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%. The company also expects a gross profit margin of 84.5% for its subscription services, with an operating income margin of 29.5% and a free cash flow margin of 31%.
Overall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

20241125,NOW,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL –November 15, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Toast TOST, as the Bull of the Day and Clean Harbors CLH, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ServiceNow NOW, Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA NVDA.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Toast is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that offers a cloud-based point-of-sale system for restaurants. The company provides tools for order management, payments, online ordering, and customer engagement, all aimed at streamlining restaurant operations.
The stock has soared to multi-year highs this month following an earnings report that exceeded expectations. Now up over 100% for 2024, investor interest remains strong as many continue to bet on the stock’s ongoing upward momentum.
About the Company
Toast, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is valued at approximately $22 billion and employs around 5,500 people.
With its point-of-sale (POS) system as the core, Toast simplifies day-to-day operations for restaurants, enabling seamless transaction processing, order tracking, and kitchen communication.
Its platform also includes features for managing employee payroll, tips, and scheduling, as well as robust reporting and analytics tools to help restaurants drive data-driven decisions.
Toast has expanded to include online ordering, delivery integrations, and marketing solutions, helping restaurants optimize their operations and grow revenue in a competitive market.
The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “A” in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock has a “F” in Value.
Q3 Earnings Beat
On November 7th, the company reported a 600% EPS beat and raised its FY guidance.
Q3 EPS came in at $0.07 v the $0.01 expected, while revenues were $1.31B v the $1.29B expected.
The company raised FY24 adjusted EBIOTDA to $352M up from $285-$305M. Non-GAAP subscription services and financial technology solutions gross profit $1.40-1.41B (+32-33% y/y), which was up from the 1.36B (+27-29% y/y) prior.
Gross Payment Volume was up 24% y/y, while annual Recurring Revenue was up 28% y/y. Total locations were +28% y/y, up to 127k.
Management comments were overwhelmingly bullish:
“Toast delivered a strong third quarter, adding approximately 7,000 net new locations, growing our recurring gross profit streams 35%, and achieving Adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. We are well positioned to finish out the year strong and carry this momentum into 2025.”
Estimates Headed Higher
Analysts are bullish as well, lifting estimates and price targets since the earnings report.
Story Continues
For the current quarter, earnings estimates doubled, going from $0.01 to $0.02.
For the current year, estimates also improved, going from a loss of $0.10 to a loss of only $0.07.
For the next year, the bottom line moves into the black. Analysts now see $0.33, which is up 18% from the $0.28 expected before earnings.
Toast, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Toast, Inc. Quote
With the big beat and guide higher, analysts are lifting their price targets.
JPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on Toast and raised its price target from $28 to $36. Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating, increasing its target from $33 to $45. Meanwhile, Wedbush kept an Outperform rating, adjusting the price target from $35 to $45.
The Technical Take
The stock is on the verge of a clear breakout, hitting levels not seen since 2021. The company IPO’d that year, trading all the way up to $69. However, it was straight down from there, with TOST making a low under $12 back in 2022.
After trading sideways for the last couple years, the stock has broken the technical resistance between $27-30 and surged higher.
With the stock at $40, investors might be hesitant to chase, so let us look at some levels to buy on a pullback.
Post earnings low: $36
Gap fill: $33
21-day: $32
50-day: $29.20
200-day: $25.20
Fibonacci buy zone (50%-61.8% retracements): $29.70-$32
While that 200-day might be out of reach, investors could start to build positions at those higher levels.
In Summary
Toast is emerging as a leader in the restaurant technology space, capitalizing on its impressive growth trajectory and strong market momentum.
The company's recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and expanding footprint reflect its ability to deliver value across restaurant operations, from order management to financial analytics.
As Toast looks to carry its growth into 2025, it remains a stock to watch for those betting on the future of digital transformation in the restaurant industry.
Bear of the Day:
Clean Harbors  is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an environmental services company providing waste management, pollution control, and energy services across North America. It specializes in hazardous waste disposal, emergency spill response, and industrial cleaning for industries like manufacturing, chemicals, and oil & gas.
The company reported earnings late last month that caused the stock to fall 17%, only to fully recover a week later. But were the buy-the-dippers too quick to jump in?
With an earnings miss and reduced guidance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward. This rally may present an ideal opportunity to exit the stock before potential declines set in.
About the Company
Clean Harbors was founded in 1980 and is based in Norwell, MA. The company employs over 21,000 people and operates through two segments: Environmental Services (83% of revenues) and Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (17% of revenues).
The company serves clients such as Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Clean Harbors offers end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning, and recycling services. Additionally, it is the world’s largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil and a leading provider of parts washers and environmental services for the commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors.
CLH isvalued at $14 billion and has a Forward PE of 35. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “D” in Value, But “B” in both Momentum and Growth.
Q3 Earnings
The company reported earnings at the end of October, missing by 1.4%. EPS came in at $2.12 versus the $2.15 consensus, but revenue exceeded projections at $1.53 billion.
Despite year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA (+19%) and free cash flow (+26%), the company lowered its FY24 guidance, citing pressures in its Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) segment, including weak base oil demand and pricing challenges.
Positive momentum remains in Environmental Services, where Field Services grew 68%, partly due to the HEPACO acquisition. Clean Harbors expects further growth opportunities in 2025 from new initiatives, like the upcoming incinerator in Nebraska, despite current market headwinds.
While there is some optimism, analysts have been quick to drop earnings estimates.
Earnings Estimates
Estimates have seen significant cuts across all time frames since the earnings report.
For the current quarter, forecasts have dropped 19% over the past 30 days, from $1.76 to $1.42.
Looking to next quarter, estimates have declined 10% in that same period, down from $1.53 to $1.38.
For the full year, projections have been adjusted downward by 5%, now at $7.29 from $7.65. Next year’s outlook follows this downward trend, with estimates reduced by 4.5%, from $8.57 to $8.18.
Technical Take
The drop after earnings was a very sharp move that might have caught some off-guard. However, the stock bounced right back, almost making new highs on the year.
This volatility is not common for a stock that has seen a slow and steady rise all year. With the stock up 45% on the year, investors may want to use this rally to take profits.
The drop almost tested the 200-day Moving average at $220, but if we start seeing a long-term trend lower, that could come into play again. For now, the stock is above the 50-day MA at $249, but investors should get cautious if this level breaks.
The stock has been a fantastic performer since the COVID crash, but the earnings down move could be a red flag.
In Summary
Clean Harbors has shown resilience and strong growth over recent years, but the recent earnings miss and reduced guidance have introduced new uncertainties.
With significant downward revisions in earnings estimates, the company may face challenges ahead, particularly within its Safety-Kleen segment. The swift bounce-back in stock price following the post-earnings drop could present a prime opportunity for investors to exit on strength, especially as technical indicators suggest caution if the stock fails to hold above key moving averages.

Let us dig deeper to find out the factors driving NOW’s prospects.
ServiceNow Raises Subscription Revenue Guidance
For 2024, NOW expects subscription revenues of $10.655-$10.66 billion (up from previous guidance of $10.575-$10.585 billion), which suggests a rise of 23% from the 2023 actuals on a GAAP basis and 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis.

ServiceNow, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ServiceNow, Inc. Quote
The consensus mark for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.97 billion, suggesting growth of 22.33% over the 2023 reported figure.
Strong Portfolio Aids NOW’s Prospects
ServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW’s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.
ServiceNow’s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.
The Xanadu update adds the latest AI capabilities to boost customer agility, enhance productivity and improve employee experiences. It expands the GenAI portfolio to enterprise functions, including Security, and Sourcing & Procurement Operations.
NOW plans to integrate Agentic AI into the ServiceNow platform and unlock 24/7 productivity at a massive scale. This service will be available this November for Customer Service Management AI Agents and IT Service Management AI Agents. It is expected to reduce the time to resolve an issue and make live agents more productive.
Strong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive
A strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.
NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.
The strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.
In third-quarter 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.
NOW’s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation
However, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.
In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector’s 6.37X.
We believe that the strong growth prospect justifies ServiceNow’s premium valuation.
Conclusion
ServiceNow’s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its clientele, boosting subscription revenues. The Growth Score of B makes the stock attractive for growth-oriented investors.
ServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which implies that investors should start accumulating the stock right now. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

20241125,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks news you must read today.
Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ to discuss the market’s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we’ve had some ""very good"" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force.

Hickey’s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period.
Developments in the AI Landscape
With AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn’t anyone who doesn’t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the “Future 40”. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology.
Artificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure”, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China’s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act “as ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.”
Story Continues
As per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden’s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments “to give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure”, amongst other things.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Strong Portfolio Aids NOW’s Prospects
ServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. NOW’s expanding GenAI capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.

ServiceNow’s latest update, Xanadu, offers AI-powered, purpose-built industry solutions for domains, including telecom, media, and technology, financial services and the public sector.

Strong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive
A strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.

NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.

NOW’s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation

In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.7X, higher than its median of 13.72X and the sector’s 6.37X.

20241126,META,"We recently published a list of 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.
Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.
“Just to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we’ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get—very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they’ve trained haven’t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, “There is no wall,” so maybe it’s not an issue—we’ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.”
However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.
“I think if you take a longer-term view—2 to 4 years—we’re still very confident we’ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn’t mean there won’t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we’ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.”

“Meta came out, had solid results, but they always guide conservatively in the September quarter for the outlook, and the stock sold off, which is what we expected it to do.”
Despite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg’s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).
According to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta’s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.
Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.”
Overall, META ranks 3rd on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

20241126,META,"Mark your calendars: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is heading to court on April 14, 2025, and the stakes couldn't be higher. The FTC is accusing the tech giant of throwing its weight around by overpaying for Instagram and WhatsApp to crush emerging competition instead of, you know, competing fairly. This showdown is about more than just old acquisitionsit's a battle over whether antitrust laws can keep up with the breakneck speed of today's tech landscape.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.
Judge James Boasberg isn't making it easy for the FTC, though. While he's allowing the trial to move forward, he's already flagged serious challenges with their case. Meta's defense? The market has changed. Rivals like TikTok, YouTube of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and LinkedIn of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are thriving, so calling them a monopoly feels like reaching. But the FTC isn't backing down, arguing Meta's dominance in personal social networks didn't happen by chanceit happened by design.
For investors, this trial is the ultimate watch-and-wait game. If the FTC scores a win, it could shake up how Big Tech does business, especially when it comes to mergers and acquisitions. But if Meta prevails, it might reinforce the company's grip on the digital ecosystem and set a new benchmark for how far regulators can push antitrust cases. Either way, April 2025 isn't just a court dateit's a moment that could reshape the rules of the tech game for years to come.

Large language models power AI chatbots and they are the hottest items on Wall Street these days. Several hyperscalers have launched their own LLMs and chatbots in the past few months. Any updates related to these chatbots are followed eagerly by analysts. Anthropic, an AI startup that developed the Claude AI model, recently proposed a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the data that powers them. The startup claims that the system, called the Model Context Protocol, which is open source, would help AI models produce better and more relevant responses to queries.

In a blog post, the AI startup underlined that as AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. However, the post added, even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data — trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Anthropic claims that MCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications.

20241126,META,"By Renju Jose
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Google and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms urged the Australian government on Tuesday to delay a bill that will ban most forms of social media for children under 16, saying more time was needed to assess its potential impact.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's centre-left government wants to pass the bill, which represents some of the toughest controls on children's social media use imposed by any country, into law by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.
The bill was introduced in parliament last week and opened for submissions of opinions for only one day.
Google and Meta said in their submissions that the government should wait for the results of an age-verification trial before going ahead.
The age-verification system may include biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off.
""In the absence of such results, neither industry nor Australians will understand the nature or scale of age assurance required by the bill, nor the impact of such measures on Australians,"" Meta said.
""In its present form, the bill is inconsistent and ineffective.""
The law would force social media platforms, and not parents or children, to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million ($32 million) for systemic breaches.
The opposition Liberal party is expected to support the bill though some independent lawmakers have accused the government of rushing through the entire process in around a week.
A Senate committee responsible for communications legislation is scheduled to deliver a report on Tuesday.
Bytedance's TikTok said the bill lacked clarity and that it had ""significant concerns"" with the government's plan to pass the bill without detailed consultation with experts, social media platforms, mental health organisations and young people.
""Where novel policy is put forward, it's important that legislation is drafted in a thorough and considered way, to ensure it is able to achieve its stated intention. This has not been the case with respect to this Bill,"" TikTok said.
Elon Musk's X raised concerns that the bill will negatively impact the human rights of children and young people, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information.
The U.S. billionaire, who views himself as a champion of free speech, last week attacked the Australian government saying the bill seemed like a backdoor way to control access to the internet.

20241126,META,"(Bloomberg) -- Global tech giants including Meta, TikTok and Google have heavily criticized Australian legislation to ban children under 16 from accessing social media platforms, setting the stage for a policy fight as the government tries to push the bill through parliament this week.

Under the proposed law, Australians under 16 years of age will be prohibited from setting up accounts on all major social media sites including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Reddit, even if they obtain parental permission. The social media giants will be responsible for policing the ban, under threat of fines of up to A$50 million ($32.5 million).
The center-left Labor government has not laid out how proposed age verification technology will work, although Communication Minister Michelle Rowland told her parliamentary colleagues last week that it would not involve uploading personal identification.

The Australian Senate, or upper house of parliament, is holding a short inquiry into the legislation which is due to report by Tuesday; however, given the legislation has support from the center-right opposition it is all but certain to become law within days.
In submissions to the Senate inquiry, tech companies warned of unintended, negative consequences from the rapidly-drafted laws.
TikTok ANZ’s Director of Public Policy Ella Woods-Joyce described the legislation as “rushed” and “unworkable” in her submission, pointing to poor privacy safeguards. Meta said the social media ban “overlooks the practical reality of age assurance technology.”
Both Meta and Google said it was important for Australia to wait until a national trial of age verification technology was completed before passing the bill.
“In the absence of such results, neither industry nor Australians will understand the nature or scale of age assurance required by the Bill nor the impact of such measures on Australians,” Meta said in its submission.
At the same time, Elon Musk’s X Corp said the bill was “alarming,” adding that it had “serious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill,” potentially setting up a court challenge to the legislation.

“There is no evidence that banning young people from social media will work, and to make it law in the form proposed is highly problematic,” X said in a submission to the committee, adding that the bill was “vague.” Musk’s social media site, formally known as Twitter, has already taken the Australian government to court multiple times over its attempts to rein in social media.
Almost all tech companies warned that the laws could also damage the mental health of young Australians if they were rushed through, by cutting off vulnerable teenagers from online community support networks.

20241126,META,"We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.
With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.
Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.
Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that ""it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions."" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to ""prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.""
To prove that ""equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,"" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that ""market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House."" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.
Story Continues
The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.
Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank ""urges caution"" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.
Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'
Between then and now, the bank believes that ""generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage."" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms ""building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.""
While generative AI might be in the ""trough of disillusionment,"" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the ""overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032"" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.
Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.
However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.
According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is ""more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud."" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.
Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.
Our Methodology
To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)
Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations.
Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”
Overall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241126,AAPL,"It's all eyes on artificial intelligence PC demand and tariffs for HP Inc. (HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores entering 2025.
""Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be,"" Lores told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday (video above).
The comments on prices to consumers echo some of those made by Best Buy CEO Corie Barry today on her call with reporters.
Lores said he is looking forward to working with the incoming Trump administration and prefers smooth trading relationships between countries.
""We are a global company that does business in many parts of the globe, and that does development in many parts of the globe, and that has manufacturing in many parts of the globe. So for us, an easy way of trading across countries is the preferred option,"" Lores added.

As tariff convos whipsaw markets, HP released mixed fiscal fourth quarter sales results after the market close.
Sales of consumer PCs fell 4% in the quarter, while commercial sales improved 5%. Operating margins in the PC division fell sharply year over year.
Similar to the previous quarter, commercial clients are upgrading their computers ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025.
Consumer PCs are under slight pressure as people await new AI computer releases and spend more money on experiences.
Worldwide shipments of traditional PCs in the calendar year third quarter hit 68.8 million, down 2.4% year over year, according to data from IDC. Sales were hurt by rising costs and inventory replenishment in the prior quarter, IDC explained.
Earnings analysis
Net sales: $14.1 billion (+1.7% year over year) vs. $13.9 billion estimate
Personal systems sales: $9.6 billion (+2% year over year) vs. $9.7 billion estimate
Consumer personal system sales: -4%
Commercial personal system sales: +5%
Printing sales: $4.5 billion (+1% year over year) vs. $4.2 billion estimate
Consumer printing sales: +3%
Commercial printing sales: -1%
Diluted earnings per share (EPS): $0.93 (+3% year over year) vs. $0.93 estimate (guidance: $0.89-$0.99)
What else caught our attention
Weak margins: Quarterly operating margins dropped to 8.5% from 9% a year ago
Personal systems operating margins fell to 5.7% from 6.7% a year ago
Printing operating margins rose to 19.6% from 18.9% a year ago
Fiscal first quarter EPS guidance: $0.70 to $0.76 vs. $0.86 estimate
Full-year EPS guidance: $3.45 to $3.75 vs. $3.60 estimate
Story Continues
""Demand, without a doubt, has returned for PCs amongst consumers and commercial buyers,"" IDC research manager Jitesh Ubrani said. ""However, much of the demand was still concentrated at the entry-level thanks to a recovering economy and the back-to-school season in North America. That said, newer AI PCs such as Copilot+ PCs from Qualcomm along with Intel and AMD's equivalent chips as well as Apple's expected M4-based Macs are expected to drive the premium segment in coming months.""
Where HP surprised favorably for the first time in a while was its printing business.
Printing sales rose 1% from the prior year and came in ahead of expectations. The upside could stem from struggles at rival Xerox (XRX), which is smack in the middle of deep restructuring that pros say is causing market share loss.
""On print, results from peers such as Xerox came in below expectations, with Xerox's printing equipment sales declining double-digits year over year due in part to an increase in competitive activity in certain markets,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a client note.
Lores said HP is ""gaining share"" in the printing business, though declined to call out Xerox and cautioned the industry remains volatile.
""We think that the overall print market in 2025 will slightly decline. The decline will be less than what we saw this year, but our goal continues to be to perform better than the market,"" Lores said.

20241126,AAPL,"President-elect Donald Trump announced his day-one intentions for tariffs on three of the United States' top trading partners late Monday.
In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said he would pass an executive order on his first day in office imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as a 10% tariff on goods from China ""above any additional tariffs.""
A reminder to investors that the incoming president once described himself as a ""tariff man"" and appears not to have lost this enthusiasm.
""Trump doesn't see allies, only adversaries,"" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note Tuesday morning.
""Now it's Canada and Mexico in the firing line, but Europe could easily catch the next stray bullet.""

""This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!"" Trump wrote. ""Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem.""
Migration across the US-Mexico border has fallen sharply in 2024 since its dramatic increase last year.
""The implication seems to be that the countries could avoid these tariffs by presenting credible plans to take action to reduce drug supply or secure their borders, much like how Mexico staved off a similar threat from Trump in 2019,"" Brown wrote.
Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them?
Trump's tariff threats may also face legal challenges, as Yahoo Finance’s Ben Werschkul noted Tuesday. His tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada would potentially violate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) he signed into law in 2020, though the trade deal between the countries is up for renegotiation in 2026.
And unlike blanket tariffs, duties aimed at specific countries have strong legal protections.
Still, Brown noted, ""Existing free trade agreements won't save countries from Trump’s cable-news wrath.""
On Tuesday, shares of American automakers suffered, with General Motors (GM) stock falling 8.5% while Stellantis (STLA) dropped 5.5% and Ford (F) slipped 2.3%.
European automakers Volkswagen (VWAGY), Mercedes (MBGAF), and BMW (BMW.DE) also saw declines as the tariff threats raised questions about the future of their operations in Mexico.
Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports cut into the profits of automakers such as Ford and General Motors. A Federal Reserve study found these tariffs also led to a reduction in manufacturing jobs.

American retailers such as Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) have also been bracing for potential impacts on their production costs.
Others have reiterated their support for Chinese operations amid these tariff threats, with Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook saying during his visit to China this week, ""I value [Apple's partners in China] very highly. We could not do what we do without them.""
Apple manufactures most of its iPhones through Foxconn in China, and China is its second-largest consumer market.
The uncertainty that follows Trump's diplomacy-by-social-media tactic also has investors cautioning about overreacting to this or any development around trade and tariffs before any policy or proposal is finalized.
""Our view remains that tariffs will eventually not end up as bad as feared, but we will see increased uncertainty over the coming months,"" Jefferies analyst Mohit Kumar wrote in a note to investors Tuesday.
""Tariffs will further support the view of US over rest of the world from an investment perspective,"" Kumar wrote, suggesting these duties may offer an opportunity for investors.
Capital Economics' Brown added that, ""Given the likelihood that these types of threats will be commonplace for the next four years, there is a risk of overinterpreting them.""
Still, the speed with which Trump appears to be putting plans in place signals the incoming president is looking to ""move much more quickly with tariffs than during his first term.""

20241126,AAPL,"Huawei Technologies launched its flagship Mate 70 smartphone models, introducing its new HarmonyOS NEXT operating system amid growing fears of U.S. export restrictions on Chinese chipmakers.
The Mate 70 Pro costs 6,499 yuan ($896); the Mate 70 range begins at 5,499 yuan ($759). The Mate 70 Pro+ runs at 8,499 yuan ($1,172). Apple (AAPL, Financials) offers its basic iPhone 16 model in China for 5, 999 yuan ($826), by contrast.
Huawei started gathering Mate 70 series pre-orders last week. The phones include an AI-capable interface with real-time translation and voice restoration tools and enable Tiantong satellite calls featuring a new satellite paging capability.
Designed as part of Huawei's attempt to cut reliance on American technology, the Mate 70 represents the first significant release of HarmonyOS NEXT, the Android-free operating system built by the firm.
With an aim of reaching 100,000 apps in the next months, the business also revealed it secured over 15,000 applications for its HarmonyOS ecosystem.
Concerns about the U.S. government possibly imposing additional export restrictions, which may put up to 200 Chinese semiconductor firms to a trade blacklist, therefore restricting access to American suppliers, accompany the launch.
Launched immediately after Apple's release of the iPhone 16 series on Sept. 9, Huawei claimed in September receiving over 3 million pre-orders for its triple-folding Mate XT smartphone on its Vmall website. Surprising many observers with its purported 5G capabilities despite U.S. prohibitions on essential technologies, the Mate 70 replaces the Mate 60 series, which was introduced secretly in August of last year.
Once a major rival of Apple and Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, Financials) in the worldwide mobile industry, U.S. regulations starting in 2019 limited Huawei's access to chipmaking equipment for sophisticated smartphone models, therefore posing serious obstacles to once major rival.
Huawei unveiled the Pura 70 series in April, including the Kirin 9010 chipa follow-up to the Kirin 9000s allegedly manufactured by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMICY, Financials)reportedly for the Mate 60 Pro.

Shares of Genie Energy have underperformed the Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry over the past year (-36.3% vs. +20.8%). Per the Zacks analyst, the company faced revenue decline, margin contraction and pressure from lower electricity sales, with RCEs and meter counts decreasing. Additionally, increased captive insurance liability and dependence on favorable market conditions pose risks. Volatility in solar projects and fluctuating energy prices add uncertainty.

20241126,AAPL,"Apple (AAPL, Financials) is encountering challenges in its efforts to introduce the Apple Intelligence AI model for iPhones and other products in China, amid stringent regulatory requirements, the Financial Times said.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with F.
Senior official from the Cyberspace Administration of China said that unless they work with local businesses, foreign enterprises undergo an extended approval procedure. Using pre-approved major language models from Chinese enterprises will speed clearance, the official said, as revealed at last week's World Internet Conference in Wuzhen.
On Monday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook made his third visit this year to China. Cook engaged in trade talks with executives from over twenty companies and Premier Li Qiang. His trip is a part of the company's continuous attempts to negotiate China's legal environment and introduce Apple Intelligence to the country.
To help the implementation of its AI model in China, the U.S.-based business allegedly has been in talks with Chinese technology companies like internet search giant Baidu (BIDU, Financials), TikHub parent ByteDance, and AI startup Moonshot. Apple started unveiling first Apple Intelligence features in the United States last month.
Cook visited China in October and previously noted the country's complicated regulations. Cook stated, speaking to local media, ""There is a very specific regulatory process behind this, and we need to complete this process.""
Apple has thought about introducing its own big language devices in China, but legal clearance still poses a major obstacle. The representative of the Cyberspace Administration said that working with local partners could be the most practical road forward.

20241126,AAPL,"Tim Long, a Barclays analyst in a note to clients Tuesday, warned Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may suffer ""incidental damage"" from the Department of Justice's continuous antitrust investigation of Google (GOOG, GOOGL).
Apple is not directly involved in the matter, but Long pointed out that the result might significantly impact its revenue and earnings model. About 15% of Apple's operating income comes from Google's payments to them for traffic acquisition expenses, hence they could be at risk.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with BLRX.
Long said, ""Although the initial implications appear negative for Apple's revenue and earnings, the company could offset lost revenue by expanding its own advertising stack."" With a $184 price target, he assigns an underweight rating on the stock.
Long also emphasized that the lack of openness about Apple's use of such payments fuels more doubt. He pointed out that although the action is probably going to be appealed for years before any decision is reached, should major adjustments be imposed, Apple's financial situation may suffer.

20241126,AAPL,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.
As the “AI arms race” continues to evolve, countries are increasingly beginning to realize the efforts they need to expend to stay relevant. One such country in the picture that’s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.

The remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do ""everything they can to lock their digital doors"" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.
""While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it"".
McFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.
In other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.
The search, which started on November 1st took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it “cannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs’ copied articles were used to build [OpenAI’s] models”.
Story Continues
“News plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week’s worth of its experts’ and lawyers’ work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today”.
OpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational corporation and technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide. Apple Intelligence is the company’s personal intelligence system.
On November 22, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc.

The effort aims to catch up with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other voice services.

The new Siri will be released as early as spring 2026.

20241126,AAPL,"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/cfpb-expands-oversight-to-paypal-and-block-says-new-street
New Street says the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s finalized rule that it will soon supervise non-bank firms that offer financial services includes PayPal (PYPL), Block (SQ), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Amazon (AMZN) and Zelle. Unsurprisingly, banks supported these actions after facing competitive pressure from tech firms moving into financial services, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm believes it is not yet known whether the Trump administration will decide to change or kill the new rule. The new rule will force oversight of non-bank financial firms in the areas of privacy, consumer complaints around errors and fraud, and losing banking access, contends New Street. It believes the rule is “somewhat significant,” though “far from game-changing for the likes of PayPal.” There’s only a small probability that the new Trump administration will keep many elements of the final rule proposed by the current CFPB leadership, according to New Street.

Shares in chipmaker Nvidia fell 4% in the previous session, seeing it lose its title as the world's most valuable company, pulling it back into second place behind Apple (AAPL).
Monday's fall in shares left Nvidia with a market valuation of $3.3tn (£2.6tn) compared to Apple's $3.5tn.
The stock declined following reports that Nvidia executive Jay Puri had met with China's vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen.

20241126,AAPL,"Huawei Technologies kept a lid on what, if any, chip advancements sit inside its Mate 70 series smartphones during a launch event on Tuesday, as the tech giant looks to take a bigger bite out of Apple's market share in China.
Richard Yu Chengdong, chairman of Huawei's consumer business group, took the stage in Shenzhen to unveil the Mate 70 and three more premium handsets in the same line, with a starting price of 5,499 yuan (US$760). He called the new series ""the most powerful Mate phones in history"", without mentioning any details about the processor that powers them.
Instead, Yu highlighted the HarmonyOS Next operating system, which the company says offers 40 per cent better performance on the latest smartphones over the Mate 60 series. HarmonyOS Next is Huawei's home-grown mobile operating system that has diverged from Android to the point of no longer being compatible with those apps.

Huawei also touted its latest artificial intelligence (AI) features, such as photo enhancement and hand gestures, which include the ability to grab and release images for sharing to different devices.
The Mate 70 line has been highly anticipated since the launch of the Mate 60 last year marked Huawei's return to China 5G smartphone market. Photo: Weibo/ 旺仔百事通 alt=The Mate 70 line has been highly anticipated since the launch of the Mate 60 last year marked Huawei's return to China 5G smartphone market. Photo: Weibo/ 旺仔百事通>
The release of the Mate 70 has been closely watched by the industry looking for any indication that it would be able to advance beyond the China-made processor in last year's Mate 60 devices. That chip was said to have been produced by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) using a 7-nanometre process. US sanctions on Huawei and SMIC have sought to restrict access to such technology.
The Mate 60 ignited patriotic fervour at home, helping reverse Huawei's flagging smartphone sales and enabling it to take on Apple and domestic rivals such as Xiaomi. The subsequent Pura 70 series handsets, which reportedly run on chips produced with the same 7nm process, helped put the firm back among the top Chinese Android brands.
Shipments of Mate 70 series handsets are expected to exceed 10 million units throughout its life cycle, according to Counterpoint Research, making it another important flagship product for Huawei.
Story Continues
When pre-orders opened on Huawei's online store on November 18, more than 3.2 million people signed up prior to the official release. Signing up did not require a deposit.
Huawei's global sales in the first three quarters of 2024 grew 51 per cent compared with the same period last year, with 90 per cent coming from mainland China, according to Counterpoint.
""With no support for Android apps, Huawei can optimise HarmonyOS by focusing 100 per cent of its efforts on maximising the performance of its self-developed Kirin chips, providing a consistent user experience, and accelerating the integration of on-device and cloud AI systems, similar to what Apple has done with iOS,"" Counterpoint analysts Mengmeng Zhang and Archie Zhang said on Tuesday.
Still, it will take time for Huawei to expand its developer community and build a competitive ecosystem for the OS, they added.
The Mate 70 series stands to further strengthen Huawei's position in the world's largest smartphone market, as it looks to reclaim ground it lost after Washington first sanctioned the firm in 2019. Huawei briefly surpassed Samsung Electronics and Apple in global smartphone shipments before the bite of US sanctions all but crippled its handset business.
Huawei's third-quarter smartphone shipments on the mainland rose 42 per cent year on year to take 15.3 per cent of the market, behind market leader Vivo and second-ranked Apple, according to an IDC report last month.

20241126,AAPL,"Google has a lot at stake if the Justice Department succeeds in breaking up its empire, from control over its search data and Android operating system to the loss of its Chrome browser.
But the biggest threat the company faces is to a search business that is deeply woven into the technology ecosystem of its parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).
Of the $307.3 billion in revenue Google made in 2023, $175 billion came solely from that ad-driven search engine business. The DOJ wants to impose dozens of limitations on the way that Google connects that engine with consumers.
Other parts of Alphabet could also be affected. The DOJ also asked for the company to be prohibited from favoring its video subsidiary, YouTube, which is part of its YouTube Ads business unit.
That unit, which generated $31.3 billion in revenue in 2023, earns money through ads that appear on and around YouTube videos. Google search promotes YouTube video links in response user queries.
Google's digital ads business, a division that generated $31.5 billion in revenue in 2023, could also be imperiled by a limitation on search favoring YouTube. Advertisers as well as content creators use Google's buyer- and seller-side platforms to target consumers and monetize video content.
It will be up to District of Columbia Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ’s monopoly argument in a trial that wrapped up earlier this year, to approve any of the proposals submitted by prosecutors. That could include the sale of Google's Chrome browser and a divestment of its Android mobile operating system.
Even artificial-intelligence investments designed to pay off in the future could be under threat. Prosecutors also called for Google to divest within six months any investment or ownership in rival query-based AI products, as well as rival search text advertising technology products.
That would force Google to unwind its partnership with generative AI startup Anthropic. Google has invested $2 billion in Anthropic, while also hiring the founders of another AI startup, Character.AI.
Taken together, the Justice Department’s requests would dramatically alter the tech landscape. Some legal experts said there is a slim chance Mehta will grant all of the prosecutors' proposals.

""I think it's pretty unlikely that the government will be successful in getting these things,"" Columbia Law School antitrust professor Erik Hovenkamp told Yahoo Finance.
""In particular, I do not expect the court to order any divestiture. Contrary to popular misconception, antitrust rarely breaks up monopolies.""
Story Continues
The $20 billion threat to Apple
The remedy legal experts say is most likely to be granted is a request to prohibit Google from agreements that secure its search engine as the default in browsers and on mobile devices.
That could hurt Google partners more than Google itself.
One is Apple (APPL). In 2022, Google paid Apple roughly $20 billion for default placement of Google Search on Apple’s Safari browser and to power search access points like the Siri voice assistant.
""Google would not have to pay $20 billion anymore, so they would gain market cap,"" said Jean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine rival Brave. ""And that would be super perverted, because suddenly the perpetrator is being compensated.""
Cash from Google’s payments falls under Apple’s services segment, which brought in some $78.1 billion in 2022. Eliminating Google’s payments would effectively cut 25% of the services segment’s revenue from that year.
CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, on Apple's campus in Cupertino, Calif., in September. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo · REUTERS / Reuters
Schmetz hypothesized that if Google’s default contracts are prohibited, and no money flows between browsers and its search engines, Apple would stand to lose $500 billion in market cap, and Google would gain $500 billion.
""There would be $23 billion times the multiple of Apple that would just basically stop existing,"" Schmetz said.
Another roughly $6 billion flows from Google to a group of browsers, mobile device manufacturers and wireless service providers, including Mozilla, Samsung, Sony, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.
'A fool's errand'
Some experts have doubts the DOJ’s plans will effectively open up the markets for search and mobile.
Instead of dismantling Google, the Justice Department should force Google and Big Tech cohorts to be more open and interoperable, said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab and a research scientist at the MIT Sloan School.
""I think it’s a fool’s errand,"" Catalini told Yahoo Finance.
If the DOJ's remedies are denied ""then it’s all for nothing"" but if they are accepted the remedies are probably worse than the underlying issue,"" he added. ""And ironically, there's a lot more that could be done to restore competition in all of these sectors through much simpler measures.”
Those measures, he said, could include making it easier for third parties to offer their own payment services and app stores on mobile devices.
Google Play gift cards are seen in a shop in New York. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) · NurPhoto via Getty Images
""Imagine forcing multiple stores to have the same level of service in the Google ecosystem on mobile,"" Catalini said.
Google makes money on ad sales through its Play Store, and takes a 13% cut of app store sales. The company’s Android ecosystem also acts as a flywheel for its ad sales by driving users to Google Search and other services.
""Allowing for different parties to provide payments rather than just the Google payment flow in its app stores, or interpretability in messaging and in the services that platforms like Apple and Google dominate today. I think that would go much [further] in terms of really giving…businesses an opportunity to compete.""
Another of the DOJ's proposals is to force Google to sell its internet index at a ""marginal cost"" and to make its search results, ranking signals, and query understanding available to rivals for purchase for 10 years.
The proposition is a risky one, according to Schmetz, because if Google is required to make its proprietary search data available it could wipe out Brave Search API and Bing Search API — the two other US search providers that crawl and index the internet. APIs or application programming interfaces provide search results to other search engines.
""Google's price cannot be just the marginal price of providing an API - which is basically zero,"" he said, ""since it would destroy other existing businesses that are thriving.""

There’s no guarantee Mehta will agree to move forward with all or even some of the DOJ’s proposed remedies. And Google has said it will appeal the initial antitrust decision.
For now, the company has to wait and see how Mehta rules on the penalties, which is expected to happen after a remedies trial scheduled to take place in 2025.
Google also faces another antitrust trial that could end with restrictions on its separate ad tech business, if the Justice Department has its way.
Prosecutors who brought that case during President Biden's administration have already asked for a judge to force Google to divest Google Ad Manager suite, including its publisher-side ad server, DFP, and its ad exchange, AdX.
Closing arguments in that case occurred Monday and a judge is expected to rule before year end.

A latest report into the adoption of AI in the United Kingdom has revealed that even though a lot of companies are using AI, only a few have integrated the new technology into their manufacturing processes. The study, called The Future Factories was carried out earlier this year in collaboration with design software giant Autodesk. The report warns that the lack of confidence in digital technologies and AI means companies in the UK are at risk of missing out on innovation and productivity gains. It also proposes how government initiatives and regulation can support the adoption of new technologies.

The report further highlights that manufacturers were mostly using AI to manage their energy usage and reduce waste. It added that some of the manufacturing sectors in which AI was being used were predictive maintenance and supply chain optimization. Per a survey cited in the study, the biggest benefits manufacturers cited were increased efficiency, improved productivity, and automation of routine tasks. The research highlights that the benefits show the importance of lowering the barrier to entry for these technologies and the untapped potential in this field for small manufacturers.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Latest reports, published by news publication Bloomberg, suggest that the recent $4 billion investment by the tech titan into AI startup Anthropic is part of a larger plan to make the Neuron SDK, the software used to run AI workloads on the chips, more appealing. Per the report, convincing customers to switch from rival NVIDIA would require hundreds of hours of development time, and Anthropic teams working directly with AWS personnel would help bridge this gap.

Some Amazon employees and activists in 20 countries are preparing to strike or protest on Black Friday and Cyber Monday as part of the “Make Amazon Pay” demonstrations.
This is the fifth year in a row that workers at Amazon have staged the protests and strikes over what they say are poor working conditions at the company. The demonstrations will take place this Friday through Monday.
The organizers said they demand that Amazon pay its workers fairly and respect their right to join unions, pay its fair share of taxes, and commit to environmental sustainability.
“Amazon’s relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy,” Christy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union said in a news release.

Switzerland-based labor federation UNI Global Union is spearheading the demonstrations, along with the grassroots activist group Progressive International.
According to UNI Global Union, the demonstrations will take place in the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Japan, Brazil, Turkey and other nations. In at least six Amazon locations across Germany, Amazon workers plan to go on strike. Amazon workers in New Delhi are expected to hold rallies to demand better working conditions.
“Jeff Bezos’s company has spent untold millions to stop workers from organizing, but the strikes and protests happening around the world show that workers’ desire for justice – for union representation – can’t be stopped,” Hoffman said. “We stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all. ‘Make Amazon Pay Day’ is becoming a global act of resistance against Amazon’s abuse of power.”
Along with UNI Global Union and Progressive International, the demonstrations will include members of over 80 unions, civil society organizations, environmentalists and tax watchdog firms from around the world.
In a statement to NBC, Amazon spokeswoman Eileen Hards said: “These groups represent a variety of interests, and while we’re always listening and looking at ways to improve, we remain proud of the competitive pay, comprehensive benefits, and engaging, safe work experience we provide our teams.”
It’s unclear what impact, if any, the protest could have on Amazon’s bottom line.
Seattle-based Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) posted third-quarter revenue of $158.9 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase.
For the 2024 holiday season, Amazon is projected to generate $112 billion in e-commerce sales, according to Statista. In comparison, Walmart’s e-commerce sales are projected to reach $22 billion, while Apple’s online sales are predicted to be $12 billion.

20241126,AMZN,"The holiday season is rapidly approaching, with many consumers ready to get out there and shop. And several companies, including Amazon AMZN and Walmart WMT, could see a nice boost from the period thanks to their robust digital offerings.
Let’s take a closer look at each.
Amazon Gets Bullish on Holiday Season
Concerning headline figures in Amazon’s latest quarterly release, the company exceeded both consensus EPS and sales expectations handily. EPS grew 70% year-over-year, whereas sales of $60 billion reflected an 11% climb from the year-ago period.
A big highlight of the results was the AWS results. AWS sales jumped 19% year-over-year to $27.5 billion, matching the same growth pace reported last quarter. The AWS results modestly fell short of our consensus estimate, as shown below.

The company remains bullish about what It’s got in store for customers during the holiday season, kicking off the period with its biggest-ever Prime Big Deal Days and the launch of an all-new Kindle lineup that has broadly exceeded its initial expectations.
Impressively, Online Sales of $61.4 billion came in 3.3% ahead of expectations, snapping a recent streak of negative surprises on the metric.

Walmart Keeps Shoppers Happy
Walmart’s latest quarterly release pleased investors in a big way, with the company’s digital efforts paving the way for robust results. Concerning headline figures, adjusted EPS jumped 14% higher alongside a 5.5% sales boost, continuing its recent growth trajectory.
Analysts took a bullish stance on the company’s current year outlook following the print, with the $2.47 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 6% over the last year and suggesting 12% growth year-over-year.

Notably, eCommerce sales were up 27% globally, with penetration higher across all segments and again confirming recent digital momentum for Walmart. Store-fulfilled pickup/delivery helped lead the robust digital showing, with consumers increasingly finding the service attractive.

Bottom Line
The holiday season has rapidly approached, with consumers undoubtedly ready to get out there and shop. And throughout the period, several companies could see tailwinds thanks to their digital and in-store offerings, including Amazon AMZN and Walmart WMT.
Amazon has long been a titan in the e-commerce space, establishing itself in a big way throughout the holiday seasons over the years. Walmart has also rapidly expanded its footprint concerning digital offerings, with the company also benefiting from the ‘trade-down’ development among higher-end consumers.

At least not yet.
Abercrombie & Fitch delivered another big earnings beat on Tuesday as its namesake division continued to resonate with young adults. The upside surprise came from the value-focused Hollister division — a business that is only now turning the corner amid new product introductions such as college-themed apparel.

Still, Citi analyst Paul Lejuez called the quarter ""strong"" in a note to clients.
The Street may also have been concerned that the company's inventory growth outpaced sales growth going into a holiday shopping season where consumers continue to spend cautiously.
Horowitz said the holiday season has started ""strong.""
Fresh potential tariffs on China that President-elect Trump floated late Monday also appeared to be weighing on investor sentiment. Abercrombie operates stores in China and sources apparel from the country.
Trump proposed an additional 10% tariff on all products from China, contending the country was shipping illegal drugs to the US.
CEOs such as Brooks Running' Dan Sheridan said tariffs could hammer the apparel industry on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. Former longtime Gap and J Crew CEO Mickey Drexler echoed that sentiment on Opening Bid as well.
Price increases could hurt consumer demand. Consumers would pay $13.9 billion to $24 billion more for apparel in the worst-case scenario for tariffs, the National Retail Federation estimated.

""When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,"" Horowitz said. ""It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge. In 2024 we will not be receiving more than 5% or 6% of our US receipts from China. We're taking a look at it country by country, but the agility that we've built into our supply chain is really what's going to help us manage through this.""

Amazon, Nvidia and the Walt Disney Company stocks still have upside despite the Dow's record run.
The Dow closed Monday at a new all-time high for the 45th time this year.
Register now to see our 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days report - free today!
The post-election rally came to a halt earlier last week. However, markets have bounced back, hinting at yet another rally ahead of the all-important holiday season.
Also, the fourth quarter has historically been great for stocks. This is likely to help Dow continue its northward journey. Given the positive sentiment, investors should bet on these three fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and The Walt Disney Company DIS.
These companies are strategically positioned to take advantage of the overall upward trend in the market and assure good returns.
Dow Closes at Record High
On Monday, the Dow jumped 1% or 440.06 points to close at an all-time high of 44,736.57 points. This was the blue-chip index’s 45th record close this year.
Although tech stocks have been primarily responsible for the broader rally, investors have lately been shifting focus to more economically sensitive corners of the market after the election. This has seen industrial and utility stocks gaining big, helping both the Dow and the S&P 500.
Monday’s jump came as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who is being seen as someone who would guide the economy into greener pastures without sparking inflation. Investors are hopeful about major reforms under Trump’s regime, including major tax cuts.
Dow Rally to Continue
The Dow rally gathered pace on Nov. 6, the day Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. The blue-chip index added over 1,500 points to record its biggest single-day gain since November 2022 and the biggest post-election surge in 128 years.
Following Trump's win, investors are expecting lower taxes and fewer regulations, as they see the new president as someone who openly addresses issues like the stock market and the value of the dollar.
Also, investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will continue with its rate cuts, given that inflation is slowing and nearing its 2% goal. Since September, the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates by a total of 75 basis points, taking its benchmark policy rate to a range of 4.5-4.75%.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank need not be “in a hurry” to cut rates given the strength in the economy. However, market participants are still hopeful about another rate cut in December. Markets are pricing in a 56.2% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut by the Fed in its December policy meeting.

20241126,AMZN,"Royal Philips expanded its partnership with Amazon's (AMZN, Financials) cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services to improve its HealthSuite cloud services, focusing on integrated diagnostics and generative AI processes.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.
The alliance seeks to move Philips' integrated diagnostics portfoliowhich include cardiology, digital pathology, and radiologyinto the cloud. According to Philips, further cooperation with AWS will enable healthcare results to be improved, access to insights to be strengthened, and diagnosis processes to be unified. The firms want to expand these offerings from North and Latin America into Europe.
By means of a single, cloud-based platform, Philips and AWS want to simplify diagnosis procedures and let healthcare practitioners access imaging, pathology, and clinical data. Operating on AWS infrastructure, Philips' HealthSuite imaging is meant to offer remote diagnosis tools, care team communication, and simplified reporting. The system is already being used more than 150 hospital institutions across North and Latin America.
""The collaboration between Philips and AWS gives healthcare providers scalable, secure-by-design cloud-enabled solutions to accelerate healthcare innovation,"" AWS CEO Matt Garman said. ""Combining Philips healthcare informatics portfolio with AWS generative AI capabilities gives clinicians access to imaging insights so they can deliver more effective and efficient care.""
Using Amazon's Bedrock technology, Philips is attempting to include generative artificial intelligence into healthcare processes. Reducing administrative chores, automating repetitive operations, and freeing physician time for important decisions is the aim. Philips is also looking at conversational artificial intelligence technologies to simplify clinical reporting so radiologists may provide ordered diagnostic reports using natural language.
Commenting on Philips' idea of ambient reporting utilizing generative artificial intelligence, Edward Steiner, Chief and Medical Director of The York/WellSpan Advanced Prostate Care Center in the United States, estimated a 15-20% efficiency increase. ""You simply could speak in a conversational tone and a structured report is generated within seconds,"" Steiner added.

20241126,AMZN,"Back in 2001, Amazon was in serious trouble. The dot-com bubble had burst and Amazon's stock had tanked by 90%.
Many thought it wouldn't survive. But Jeff Bezos found inspiration in an unexpected place: a coffee meeting with Jim Sinegal, the founder of Costco. According to Brad Stone’s 2013 book The Everything Store, they met at a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble near Amazon's Bellevue headquarters.

Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share
Sinegal wasn't there to offer a magic fix – he simply explained Costco's secret sauce. The key? Value. Costco kept prices incredibly low by cutting unnecessary costs, sticking to a strict 15% markup and treating suppliers fairly to secure great deals.
Sinegal told Bezos, ""The membership fee is a one-time pain, but it's reinforced every time customers walk in and see forty-seven-inch televisions that are two hundred dollars less than anyplace else.” That trust kept customers returning, knowing they'd always find great deals.
Bezos took this advice seriously. Days after the meeting, he called a team meeting at Amazon to discuss the company's pricing strategy – or lack thereof.
See Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.
The goal? Make Amazon synonymous with lower prices. According to The New York Times, Bezos famously said, ""There are two kinds of companies: those that raise prices and those that work to lower them. We are going to be the second, full-stop.""
Soon after, Amazon slashed prices on books, music and videos – its flagship products – by as much as 30%. It worked. By the end of 2001, Amazon posted its first profitable quarter. ""We had a great Q4,"" Bezos told Fox News in January 2002. ""What really drove it was lower prices for customers.""
Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.
The Costco connection didn't stop there. Inspired by Costco's membership model, Amazon launched Prime in 2005. It wasn't just about free shipping but creating compelling value that customers couldn't resist.

Bezos described Prime in a 2016 shareholder letter: “We want Prime to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member."" Today, Prime has over 200 million members worldwide, generating more than $35 billion annually.
Costco's influence is evident not just in pricing but in Amazon's overall ethos. Take Costco's $1.50 hot dog combo, for instance – it's stayed the same price for decades. According to former Costco CEO Craig Jelinek, Sinegal once joked, ""If you raise the [hot dog] price, I will kill you.” Similarly, Amazon reinvests heavily in its logistics and technology to keep costs low and deliver on its customer-first promise.

20241126,AMZN,"For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.
Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in Amazon (AMZN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AMZN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
Amazon's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Amazon's main business drivers.
Amazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.

Its online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish footprint in physical grocery supermarket space.
Amazon also enjoys dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin generating businesses.
Amazon has also become a household name with its Alexa powered Echo devices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa is helping the company sell products and services.
Revenues were $574.8 billion in 2023. The company reports revenue under three broad heads—North America, International and AWS, which generated 61.4%, 22.8% and 15.8% of total revenues, respectively.
Headquartered in Seattle, WA, Amazon targets three categories of customers—consumers, sellers and website developers. Consumers are offered variety, convenience and free delivery of goods displayed on the company’s websites.

The agreements with sellers are varied, enabling them to use the company’s websites to either sell their merchandise directly, or redirect customers to the sellers’ own branded websites. In case of the latter arrangement, Amazon earns a fee for the sales thus generated.
Competition comes in the form of traditional retailers, other online retailers, media companies, web portals, search engines, e-commerce companies and cloud computing service providers.
Bottom Line
While anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Amazon ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.

A $1000 investment made in November 2014 would be worth $12,025.43, or a 1,102.54% gain, as of November 26, 2024, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.
Compare this to the S&P 500's rally of 189.66% and gold's return of 110.14% over the same time frame.
Analysts are forecasting more upside for AMZN too.
Amazon’s third-quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. We expect 2024 net sales to increase 10.7% from 2023. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon’s expanding global presence remains a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. The company issued positive Q4 2024 guidance fueling investor enthusiasm. However, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.
The stock has jumped 6.93% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 16 higher, for fiscal 2024; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.

New Street says the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s finalized rule that it will soon supervise non-bank firms that offer financial services includes PayPal (PYPL), Block (SQ), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Amazon (AMZN) and Zelle. Unsurprisingly, banks supported these actions after facing competitive pressure from tech firms moving into financial services, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm believes it is not yet known whether the Trump administration will decide to change or kill the new rule. The new rule will force oversight of non-bank financial firms in the areas of privacy, consumer complaints around errors and fraud, and losing banking access, contends New Street. It believes the rule is “somewhat significant,” though “far from game-changing for the likes of PayPal.” There’s only a small probability that the new Trump administration will keep many elements of the final rule proposed by the current CFPB leadership, according to New Street.

20241126,NFLX,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Netflix won the dismissal on Tuesday of a shareholder lawsuit accusing the streaming company of downplaying the impact on subscriber growth of account sharing, where paying members share user names and passwords with nonpaying members in other households.
The proposed class action led by a Texas-based trustee began after Netflix revealed in April 2022 it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the prior quarter, the first decline in a decade, and might lose 2 million more in the next three months.
Netflix blamed the decline on several factors, including account sharing, rising competition and a shutdown of service in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Its shares fell 35% the next day, wiping out more than $54 billion of market value.
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in Oakland, California, however, said Netflix's earlier claims to be ""roughly 60% penetrated"" in the United States and Canada with ""a lot of headroom"" to grow were not false or misleading, because they referred to paid subscribers and did not imply that growth was certain.
He also found no proof Netflix concealed any determination that account sharing would severely hinder growth.
""At most,"" he said, the plaintiff's allegations suggest that the Los Gatos, California-based company investigated account sharing and found it to be ""one potential threat to growth among many.""
Lawyers for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Netflix and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Tigar had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit in January. Tuesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, the trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, cannot amend his complaint again.
The case is Pirani v Netflix Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-02672. (This story has been refiled to change the location of the judge to Oakland, California, from San Francisco, in paragraph 4)

This Score examines things like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will generate sustainable growth over time.
Netflix (NFLX)
Netflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. The company evolved from a small DVD-rental provider to a dominant streaming service provider, courtesy of its wide-ranging content portfolio and a fortified international footprint.

NFLX sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Growth Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of B. Earnings and sales are forecasted to increase 64.4% and 15.4% year-over-year, respectively.
12 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.70 to $19.78 per share. NFLX boasts an average earnings surprise of 5.7%.

20241126,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Netflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.
Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Netflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Wall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $800 a share, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.
One of the main catalysts for the recent price target boosts is the company's continued foray into live events, with the most recent boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson attracting over 108 million global viewers last weekend to become the most-streamed sporting event of all time.
For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers.
The Netflix event's impressive numbers came despite the streamer experiencing several technical glitches throughout the broadcast, which analysts (and investors) mostly shrugged off.
""We view the event as a (very) successful learning experience for NFLX and expect these technical issues will not happen again with future live events,"" Pivotal Research's Wlodarczak wrote on Wednesday.
The analyst said the event's success likely means Netflix will ""accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming,"" which will help lower subscriber churn and increase the streamer's ability to raise prices.
""The NFLX service remains a highly compelling, frankly relatively inexpensive, entertainment alternative for consumers, which bodes well for future subscriber/average revenue per user growth,"" he said.
Netflix's 'complementary growth drivers'

Since the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged roughly 85%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.

Last week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.
Netflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyoncé will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.
The company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Jefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a ""breakthrough"" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.
BofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, ""Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.""
Netflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.
Still, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.
""With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.
Valuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock ""is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025."" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Netflix shares were on track for a fifth consecutive gain on Friday and set for their biggest weekly percentage rise since January, after the streaming media company's popular boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul.
The stock was last up 0.2% at $899.06, off its intraday record high of $908 on Thursday. It has risen every session since the Nov. 15 fight, taking the stock up more than 9% for the week.
Several brokerages this week raised their price targets on the stock, including BofA Global Research, which on Thursday bumped up its price target to $1,000 from $800.
Netflix said on Tuesday that 108 million people worldwide watched the match between Paul, a 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prize-fighter, and the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Tyson. The event, which Paul won, was streamed live on Netflix.

Jefferies analysts, which also raised their 12-month target on Netflix to $1,000 this week, wrote in a note on Monday that the event was ""a major breakthrough for NFLX's live events strategy.""
The median 12-month price target on Netflix is $800, with 31 analysts rating the stock a ""buy"" or ""strong buy,"" 14 rating it a ""hold,"" and two analysts rating it a ""sell,"" according to LSEG data.
Kenneth Leon, vice president and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note this week: ""NFLX is flexing its streaming capability with select live sporting events that draw from a global subscriber base.""
""Advertising is still in the early stages, but is expected to be a revenue driver by 2026,"" Leon noted. CFRA also raised its price target on Netflix.
Including the session move, the stock is up roughly 85% for the year.

20241126,NFLX,"Netflix Boxing Battle Decided In The Ring, But Paul's $16M Mansion Takes The Real Estate Crown
Jake Paul was victorious in Friday’s highly anticipated Netflix boxing match against Mike Tyson and his real estate portfolio seems to outshine the boxing legend’s holdings too.

The 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer won unanimously and bought a $16 million compound that dwarfs Tyson's Nevada residence.

Paul's recently acquired estate in Dorado, Puerto Rico, shows the social media star's success outside the ring. The eight-bedroom, eight-bathroom compound underwent $2.1 million in renovations after its 2023 purchase.

In a recent YouTube tour titled “My new $20,000,000 house tour,” Paul highlighted his changes, including a redesigned entrance for improved energy flow.
According to Realtor.com, the property includes several distinctive amenities, such as a 40-person hot tub and dedicated office space for Paul’s content production team. His garage also received a custom makeover to accommodate his growing car collection.
By comparison, Tyson's real estate footprint appears modest.

The former heavyweight champion's current residence, a $2.5 million mansion in Henderson, Nevada, has appreciated to an estimated $4.7 million, according to Realtor.com. The 8,000-square-foot home, where he lives with his wife, Lakiha Spicer and their children, has six bedrooms and six bathrooms.
Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.
According to the report, Tyson's real estate history includes a previous 19,500-square-foot estate in Southington, Ohio, which he sold for $1.3 million during financial difficulties in the late 1990s.

The 58-acre property's subsequent owner never occupied it, serving time in prison for money laundering.
The record-breaking boxing match, which earned Paul roughly $40 million and Tyson $20 million, further widens the wealth gap between the two fighters. According to CBS News, Paul said he wanted to fight again after the victory, targeting a championship title within two years. ""I truly believe in my skills, my ability and my power,"" he said, setting his sights on the cruiserweight division.

While Tyson acknowledged the loss gracefully, posting “This is one of those situations when you lost but still won” on X, formerly Twitter.

20241126,NFLX,"Think about the last time you listened to music on Spotify, watched a movie on Netflix, hailed a ride on Uber, or ordered food via DoorDash. These companies have millions of digital customers—and billions of interactions with them. They are using the insights from this data to rapidly optimize each customer’s next experience.
In the age of artificial intelligence, competitive advantage is increasingly determined by a company's ability to deliver personalized experiences at scale. We call this phenomenon the “personalization advantage,” which can be expressed by a simple formula:
P = n × v2
P represents the competitive advantage of personalization.
N is the volume of interactions from which the company can learn.
V is the speed of learning, which has an exponential impact.
The Personalization Advantage formula illustrates why these companies are winning: they have both scale (n) in terms of customer interactions and speed (v) in learning from and acting on these interactions.
Personalization is not just customization—it’s about using customer data to deliver experiences tailored in real-time, evolving with each interaction. Whether it's a website suggesting products you didn't know you needed based on prior behavior, a call center agent knowing your shopping history with the company, or a sales associate remembering your preferences, the key is scaling these interactions across millions of customers and constantly learning from them.
Personalization is creating experiences at scale that get fine-tuned with each successive interaction, empowering customers to get what they want better, faster, cheaper, or more easily. The difference lies in the way personalized communications build on everything the company learns about the customer over time, and about how other customers like them behave. In our experience across industries and consumer contexts, this is what makes personalization truly effective. This effectiveness is directly linked to the Personalization Advantage formula. The more interactions a company has (n), and the faster it can learn from them (v), the greater its personalization advantage (P) becomes.
It is enabled by the many different forms of AI available: machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and others, often combined together. Business is now effectively at the point where competitive advantage will be based on a company’s ability to relentlessly capture, analyze, and utilize customer data, at a massive scale, with every possible contact—and on how it uses that data to understand, shape, personalize, and optimize each customer’s journey.
Story Continues
Building economies of scale has always been important in business, especially in the physical aspects of competition: supply chains, production, and distribution. However, personalization changes the nature of scale in the customer experience from the mass production of goods to the mass delivery of 1:1 experiences built on accumulated intelligence. Personalization at scale, and the ongoing cycle of experimentation and learning that power it, create a competitive moat that is very hard to replicate. This competitive moat is precisely what our Personalization Advantage formula quantifies.
It’s about scale (n)
Companies such as Alipay, Amazon, Tencent, Flipkart, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify have each amassed over 200 million active users. The sheer size of their digital customer base is enormous. They distill insights about these users not just when they transact, but every time they browse or click in a digital channel. But even non-digital native companies are maximizing the “surface area” they have for gathering and using customer information—like an alarm company understanding how homeowners use their touchpads or B2B distributors tracking the frequency and nature of replenishment orders.
These companies even know the lifetime value of each new active user they add—and invest accordingly. For example, a large food and beverage company we’ve worked with estimated that each 10 million new digital customer relationships would add $1 billion in incremental revenue.
It’s about speed (v)
Ultimately, personalization is about what companies do with the insights about their customers. This is where companies are competing on speed. Speed in getting to know the customer throughout the customer journey, speed in executing based on a trigger about a customer, and speed in constantly improving the experience based on that knowledge. We are big believers in the importance of “time-based competition,” the concept of competing on the basis of speed. In personalization, it is foundational.
The squared term in our formula (v2) emphasizes the outsized impact of speed. Doubling the speed of learning and execution more than doubles the personalization advantage.
It is no coincidence that companies across a wide swath of categories, including home improvement, banking, restaurants, grocery, and apparel have publicly announced that personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences are central to their corporate strategy. These companies understand that maximizing both (n) and (v) in the Personalization Advantage formula is crucial for their success.
By studying hundreds of personalization leaders over the past decade, we have even quantified the size of the personalization advantage pioneering companies are capturing in terms of growth. Across industries, we find that personalization leaders consistently outgrow laggards. In fact, leaders grow top-line revenues 10 points faster per year than laggards. Taken together, we estimate that by the end of this decade, the personalization leaders, on a combined basis, will capture almost $2 trillion in incremental growth.
The basis of competition has shifted—and the prize for those that rethink their business model accordingly is enormous. But here’s the catch. Our research also finds that only 10% of companies qualify as personalization leaders. Many businesses say they are doing personalization but fail to go beyond basic segmented marketing. They end up sending more spam, generating more calls from complaining customers, and frustrating themselves with slower growth than expected. These laggards are failing to optimize both (n) and (v) in the personalization advantage formula, limiting their growth potential.

As tariff convos whipsaw markets, HP released mixed fiscal fourth quarter sales results after the market close.
Sales of consumer PCs fell 4% in the quarter, while commercial sales improved 5%. Operating margins in the PC division fell sharply year over year.
Similar to the previous quarter, commercial clients are upgrading their computers ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025.
Consumer PCs are under slight pressure as people await new AI computer releases and spend more money on experiences.
Worldwide shipments of traditional PCs in the calendar year third quarter hit 68.8 million, down 2.4% year over year, according to data from IDC. Sales were hurt by rising costs and inventory replenishment in the prior quarter, IDC explained.
Earnings analysis
Net sales: $14.1 billion (+1.7% year over year) vs. $13.9 billion estimate
Personal systems sales: $9.6 billion (+2% year over year) vs. $9.7 billion estimate
Consumer personal system sales: -4%
Commercial personal system sales: +5%
Printing sales: $4.5 billion (+1% year over year) vs. $4.2 billion estimate
Consumer printing sales: +3%
Commercial printing sales: -1%

Personal systems operating margins fell to 5.7% from 6.7% a year ago
Printing operating margins rose to 19.6% from 18.9% a year ago
Fiscal first quarter EPS guidance: $0.70 to $0.76 vs. $0.86 estimate
Full-year EPS guidance: $3.45 to $3.75 vs. $3.60 estimate
Story Continues
""Demand, without a doubt, has returned for PCs amongst consumers and commercial buyers,"" IDC research manager Jitesh Ubrani said. ""However, much of the demand was still concentrated at the entry-level thanks to a recovering economy and the back-to-school season in North America. That said, newer AI PCs such as Copilot+ PCs from Qualcomm along with Intel and AMD's equivalent chips as well as Apple's expected M4-based Macs are expected to drive the premium segment in coming months.""
Where HP surprised favorably for the first time in a while was its printing business.
Printing sales rose 1% from the prior year and came in ahead of expectations. The upside could stem from struggles at rival Xerox (XRX), which is smack in the middle of deep restructuring that pros say is causing market share loss.
""On print, results from peers such as Xerox came in below expectations, with Xerox's printing equipment sales declining double-digits year over year due in part to an increase in competitive activity in certain markets,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a client note.
Lores said HP is ""gaining share"" in the printing business, though declined to call out Xerox and cautioned the industry remains volatile.
""We think that the overall print market in 2025 will slightly decline. The decline will be less than what we saw this year, but our goal continues to be to perform better than the market,"" Lores said.

The post-election rally came to a halt earlier last week. However, markets have bounced back, hinting at yet another rally ahead of the all-important holiday season.
Also, the fourth quarter has historically been great for stocks. This is likely to help Dow continue its northward journey. Given the positive sentiment, investors should bet on these three fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and The Walt Disney Company DIS.
These companies are strategically positioned to take advantage of the overall upward trend in the market and assure good returns.
Dow Closes at Record High
On Monday, the Dow jumped 1% or 440.06 points to close at an all-time high of 44,736.57 points. This was the blue-chip index’s 45th record close this year.
Although tech stocks have been primarily responsible for the broader rally, investors have lately been shifting focus to more economically sensitive corners of the market after the election. This has seen industrial and utility stocks gaining big, helping both the Dow and the S&P 500.
Monday’s jump came as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who is being seen as someone who would guide the economy into greener pastures without sparking inflation. Investors are hopeful about major reforms under Trump’s regime, including major tax cuts.
Dow Rally to Continue
The Dow rally gathered pace on Nov. 6, the day Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. The blue-chip index added over 1,500 points to record its biggest single-day gain since November 2022 and the biggest post-election surge in 128 years.
Following Trump's win, investors are expecting lower taxes and fewer regulations, as they see the new president as someone who openly addresses issues like the stock market and the value of the dollar.
Also, investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will continue with its rate cuts, given that inflation is slowing and nearing its 2% goal. Since September, the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates by a total of 75 basis points, taking its benchmark policy rate to a range of 4.5-4.75%.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank need not be “in a hurry” to cut rates given the strength in the economy. However, market participants are still hopeful about another rate cut in December. Markets are pricing in a 56.2% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut by the Fed in its December policy meeting.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The share price has fluctuated since the company posted market-beating earnings numbers but guided near analyst expectations last week. Finance news platform Barron’s has advised investors not to read too much into the initial reaction, which could easily be some profit-taking given that the stock has roughly tripled this year. Per the publication, investors should ignore near-term noise, remain focused on the big picture, and not overlook the unprecedented magnitude of Nvidia's performance.

20241126,NVDA,"(Bloomberg) — There’s been a sea change among tech investors during the past month: Software stocks are hot, while semiconductor makers are not.

Wall Street is rotating out of the chip sector, put off by stretched valuations and trade war-related risks under Donald Trump. Already a vocal critic of the Chips Act, the President-elect vowed on Monday to impose additional tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Software, in contrast, has been on an upswing. Investors are positive on the group given its lower exposure to tariff risks, and as the tailwind from artificial intelligence looks set to shift from infrastructure to services.

“Software got left behind, but looks to be the next winner from AI, while it could also benefit if the new administration is more lenient on regulation and M&A,” said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Co. On the flip side, “there’s so much good news in chips, especially AI chips, that the valuation has gotten steep at a time when there’s more uncertainty.”
Recent earnings reports underline the sentiment shift. Shares in data-analysis software company Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) soared on the back of a robust forecast, while demand for AI software fueled Palantir Technologies Inc.’s blowout report. In contrast, even strong results from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) failed to excite investors.
So far in November, a major exchange-traded fund that tracks software is up 16%, putting it on track for its biggest one-month gain in a year, although it was flat on Tuesday. A semiconductor fund, meanwhile, is up less than 2% this month. Flows into the software ETF have also far eclipsed the chip fund, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.

The outperformance represents “an all-time record move for software vs. semis,” according to Michael Toomey, managing director of equities trading at Jefferies. Still, the shift “barely makes a mark in the 10-year chart” of their relative performance, suggesting room for the trend to continue, he said.
The extent of the rotation will depend on how things play out under Trump. Sean O’Hara, president of Pacer ETF Distributors, sees “a lot of uncertainty for chipmakers around the tariff side of things.” That’s created the potential for volatility, especially because chip stocks have already had a big AI-related rally. “At the same time, I think we’ll see more focus on AI software,” he said.
Story Continues
So far, the AI theme has benefited chipmakers much more than software firms, with companies pumping money into the chips and servers they need to run the technology. Meanwhile, only a few software companies — like Palantir, (PLTR) Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) — have seen meaningful AI-related tailwinds. But software and services may be the next place that sees an inflection in AI growth.

At the same time, being the first major beneficiary of the AI trade has left chipmakers looking expensive. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index trades at 24 times estimated earnings, above its 10-year average of 18, with stocks like ARM Holdings Plc and Nvidia among the most expensive. That could mean more downside risk if headwinds emerge, while Nvidia’s report showed that it may take even bigger beats to keep lifting the sector.

To be sure, semiconductor stocks remain a popular place for growth. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, earnings for chip companies are expected to grow 40% in 2025, compared with about 12% for those in the software and services industry. Sales growth is also expected to be much stronger for semiconductor firms.
The next big test for software will come in early December, when Salesforce Inc. reports results. The company has been hiring aggressively to push its new generative AI agent product, and strong results from the company will help sustain the sector’s rally, according to Jordan Klein, a tech-sector specialist at Mizuho Securities.
“Post-election, generalist and tech investors are faced with the struggle of owning much more software (and fintech) and owning a lot less semis,” he wrote. “Missing out on these moves leaves some in a bad spot.”

Let’s take a closer look at the ‘Nuclear’ theme and analyze a few stocks that the screen returned, such as Constellation Energy CEG and Vistra VST.
Nuclear Overview
Nuclear energy stands at the cusp of the global push for a low-carbon, greener, and more resilient energy future.
This investment theme encapsulates companies engaged in uranium mining, nuclear reactor construction and maintenance, and the generation of electricity from nuclear sources, alongside firms providing essential technology and services to the nuclear industry.
CEG and Microsoft Team Up
Constellation Energy found itself in the spotlight following news earlier in the year that it’d be restarting a nuclear plant in a deal with mega-cap technology giant Microsoft. Microsoft will purchase power from the plant to meet its data center needs, a theme we’ve all become familiar with amid the AI frenzy.
Up 130% YTD, CEG shares have delivered a remarkable performance relative to the S&P 500’s 27% gain. The outlook for its current fiscal year remains constructive, with the $8.14 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 21% over the last year and suggesting 60% growth year-over-year.

Vistra Upgrades Nuclear Capabilities
Vistra safely operates a reliable, efficient power generation fleet of natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Shares have been scorching hot in 2024, gaining nearly 320% and widely outperforming.

Vistra closed an acquisition of Energy Harbor earlier in 2024, which added more than 4,000 MW of nuclear generation to its portfolio alongside roughly one million retail customers. Further, the company also inked two new power purchase agreements with both Amazon and Microsoft, adding to its already favorable stance.
Shares could also attract income-focused investors, with its current 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate reflective of a shareholder-friendly nature. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s quarterly payouts.

20241126,MSFT,"It's all eyes on artificial intelligence PC demand and tariffs for HP Inc. (HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores entering 2025.
""Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be,"" Lores told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday (video above).
The comments on prices to consumers echo some of those made by Best Buy CEO Corie Barry today on her call with reporters.
Lores said he is looking forward to working with the incoming Trump administration and prefers smooth trading relationships between countries.
""We are a global company that does business in many parts of the globe, and that does development in many parts of the globe, and that has manufacturing in many parts of the globe. So for us, an easy way of trading across countries is the preferred option,"" Lores added.

As tariff convos whipsaw markets, HP released mixed fiscal fourth quarter sales results after the market close.
Sales of consumer PCs fell 4% in the quarter, while commercial sales improved 5%. Operating margins in the PC division fell sharply year over year.
Similar to the previous quarter, commercial clients are upgrading their computers ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025.
Consumer PCs are under slight pressure as people await new AI computer releases and spend more money on experiences.
Worldwide shipments of traditional PCs in the calendar year third quarter hit 68.8 million, down 2.4% year over year, according to data from IDC. Sales were hurt by rising costs and inventory replenishment in the prior quarter, IDC explained.
Earnings analysis
Net sales: $14.1 billion (+1.7% year over year) vs. $13.9 billion estimate
Personal systems sales: $9.6 billion (+2% year over year) vs. $9.7 billion estimate
Consumer personal system sales: -4%
Commercial personal system sales: +5%
Printing sales: $4.5 billion (+1% year over year) vs. $4.2 billion estimate
Consumer printing sales: +3%
Commercial printing sales: -1%
Diluted earnings per share (EPS): $0.93 (+3% year over year) vs. $0.93 estimate (guidance: $0.89-$0.99)
What else caught our attention
Weak margins: Quarterly operating margins dropped to 8.5% from 9% a year ago
Personal systems operating margins fell to 5.7% from 6.7% a year ago
Printing operating margins rose to 19.6% from 18.9% a year ago
Fiscal first quarter EPS guidance: $0.70 to $0.76 vs. $0.86 estimate
Full-year EPS guidance: $3.45 to $3.75 vs. $3.60 estimate
Story Continues
""Demand, without a doubt, has returned for PCs amongst consumers and commercial buyers,"" IDC research manager Jitesh Ubrani said. ""However, much of the demand was still concentrated at the entry-level thanks to a recovering economy and the back-to-school season in North America. That said, newer AI PCs such as Copilot+ PCs from Qualcomm along with Intel and AMD's equivalent chips as well as Apple's expected M4-based Macs are expected to drive the premium segment in coming months.""
Where HP surprised favorably for the first time in a while was its printing business.
Printing sales rose 1% from the prior year and came in ahead of expectations. The upside could stem from struggles at rival Xerox (XRX), which is smack in the middle of deep restructuring that pros say is causing market share loss.
""On print, results from peers such as Xerox came in below expectations, with Xerox's printing equipment sales declining double-digits year over year due in part to an increase in competitive activity in certain markets,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a client note.
Lores said HP is ""gaining share"" in the printing business, though declined to call out Xerox and cautioned the industry remains volatile.
""We think that the overall print market in 2025 will slightly decline. The decline will be less than what we saw this year, but our goal continues to be to perform better than the market,"" Lores said.

20241126,MSFT,"A group of artists volunteering as beta testers for OpenAI’s new and unreleased AI video product, Sora, publicly shared access to the tool on Tuesday to protest what they said were the company’s exploitative practices.
In an open letter posted on the Hugging Face platform and addressed to “corporate AI overlords,” the group published the access to Sora’s API, the special code that allows outside users to access the tool.
The group claimed they were invited by OpenAI to serve as Sora “testers” and “creative partners,” but realized they were being “lured into ‘art washing’ to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists.” They also maintained that OpenAI controlled and approved all outputs, and that the early-access program appeared to be “less about creative expression and critique, and more about PR and advertisement.”
Sora is one of the most anticipated new products from OpenAI, the privately held company that makes ChatGPT and which has been valued at $157 billion. Generative AI video technology has the potential to upend Hollywood and many other creative industries that rely on video creation, from advertising to art. As word spread online about access to the Sora model on Tuesday, users quickly began posting their video experiments. “It can be shut down anytime, try it now!” said one excited user on X. “It can generate 1080P and up to 10s video! And the results are incredible!”
Following the leak, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company has “temporarily paused user access while we look into this.” The spokesperson emphasized that Sora is still in a research preview, and that “hundreds of artists” have shaped Sora’s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards. “Participation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool,” the spokesperson said. “We’ve been excited to offer these artists free access and will continue supporting them through grants, events, and other programs. We believe AI can be a powerful creative tool and are committed to making Sora both useful and safe.”
Marc Rotenberg, founder and executive director of the Washington, D.C.–based Center for AI and Digital Policy, pointed out that the leak was “deeply ironic” since OpenAI was first established as a company whose research was open to all. “It’s the reason that Elon Musk put money into it, and it was the subsequent commercialization that explains the reason he became disenchanted,” he said. “So if you go back to his mission, I think you would celebrate what the artists did in this moment. But of course, if you’re Microsoft, and you just poured in $10 billion to further your proprietary model, this is probably not a good day,” Rotenberg said, referring to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI.
Story Continues
It’s important to note that the news of the API access is much less devastating than if the entire Sora model—including the code and weights (which serve as the “brains” behind the model) had been leaked. OpenAI quickly shut down access to the leaked API on Tuesday.
Still, the fact that the company’s own beta testers are protesting is notable: Over the past several years, artists have voiced growing concerns about exploitative practices in the realm of generative AI, particularly around issues of copyright and content usage. Generative AI models often rely on vast datasets scraped from publicly available digital content, much of which includes artwork, illustrations, and other creative works created by artists.
In addition, AI-watchers have been extremely curious to find out how the highly anticipated OpenAI Sora model performs. In February, OpenAI released several high-definition video clips generated by Sora, but there have only been occasional demo videos released since then.

A latest report into the adoption of AI in the United Kingdom has revealed that even though a lot of companies are using AI, only a few have integrated the new technology into their manufacturing processes. The study, called The Future Factories was carried out earlier this year in collaboration with design software giant Autodesk. The report warns that the lack of confidence in digital technologies and AI means companies in the UK are at risk of missing out on innovation and productivity gains. It also proposes how government initiatives and regulation can support the adoption of new technologies.

The report further highlights that manufacturers were mostly using AI to manage their energy usage and reduce waste. It added that some of the manufacturing sectors in which AI was being used were predictive maintenance and supply chain optimization. Per a survey cited in the study, the biggest benefits manufacturers cited were increased efficiency, improved productivity, and automation of routine tasks. The research highlights that the benefits show the importance of lowering the barrier to entry for these technologies and the untapped potential in this field for small manufacturers.

20241126,MSFT,"As disclosed in its most recent regulatory filing, Lakehouse Capital Pty Ltd has significantly reduced its stake in Microsoft Corporation (MSFT, Financial). The firm trimmed its holdings by 34.5%, bringing the total down to 9,472 shares from over 14,000 previously. The current value of these shares stands at approximately $4.08 million. This move reduces Microsoft's weight in the fund's portfolio to 2.9%, making it the 13th largest holding.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.
The reduction aligns with trends adopted by most institutional investors. For example, Christopher J. Hasenberg Inc. bought 169.2% more Microsoft this year, and Bellevue Group AG bought 47.5%. At the moment, the combined stake of institutional investors and hedge funds is 71.13 % of Microsoft's total stake.
Microsoft still holds a key position in the technological sector, and its stock has increased much more in percentage than others in the past year. Currently, the stock is listed as a 'Moderate Buy' due to a projected earnings growth of 14.3% in the next fiscal year. However, its relatively high P/E and P/B ratios sometimes tell a lot about the value investor strategies for exercising more caution.
Microsoft's core has deep institutional support and impressive growth prospects. However, Lakehouse Capital's dilution remains a foundation holding for many Investors.

Large language models power AI chatbots and they are the hottest items on Wall Street these days. Several hyperscalers have launched their own LLMs and chatbots in the past few months. Any updates related to these chatbots are followed eagerly by analysts. Anthropic, an AI startup that developed the Claude AI model, recently proposed a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the data that powers them. The startup claims that the system, called the Model Context Protocol, which is open source, would help AI models produce better and more relevant responses to queries.

In a blog post, the AI startup underlined that as AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. However, the post added, even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data — trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Anthropic claims that MCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications.

20241126,MSFT,"Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) said on Monday that it had regained control over Outlook and Teams services, which had stopped working globally. The problems started in the morning and concerned crucial business applications, and after they occurred, many office employees could not communicate. Before it stabilized, Downdetector captured over 5,000 reports of outages at the peak time.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.
Microsoft released a fix and claimed by the evening that most people were able to regain entry, with some Outlook web users still locked. Complete restoration should be possible by Tuesday. Earlier in the day, the company attributed slower speed to its recovery process but said it was working around the clock to address other problems.
This outage comes after a year of massive global tech disruptions. However, unlike previous events like the CrowdStrike IT failure this year, it did not have the same effect, paralyzing industries and causing billions of dollars in damages.
Such incidents have highlighted the dependence on cloud services as major business solutions. Organizations remain pressured to increase efforts to ensure their infrastructure can withstand some impacts during an outage.
To businesses and users, Microsoft's updates best illustrate the need to check service health portals for real-time recovery information continually. The tech giant also reiterated its intention to implement faster outage solutions to retain user trust in its Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. The US-China trade war is intensifying. Following US curbs on export of AI chips to Chinese firms, Microsoft recently alerted authorities in the US about the Salt Typhoon hack, according to a report by news publication The New York Times. The report claims that hackers closely linked to the Chinese government lurked undetected inside the networks of the biggest American telecommunications firms for more than a year and got a nearly complete list of phone numbers the Justice Department monitors in its lawful intercept system. It further adds that officials now believe that the hack has gone beyond phone companies, to internet service providers, potentially allowing the Chinese to read some email.

Adjusted earnings will be 84 cents to 86 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, CrowdStrike said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts were expecting 87 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates.
Shares of CrowdStrike fell about 5% in extended trading after the results were announced.
The report is the company’s second since a flawed CrowdStrike update crashed millions of devices operating on Microsoft Corp.’s Windows systems. The outage, which unfolded on July 19, disrupted a wide range of industries, including air travel, banks and health care. The company posted sales three months ago that beat expectations, a sign that investors took to mean the global IT outage wouldn’t significantly affect its finances.
Third-quarter revenue represented a bright spot in Tuesday’s report. Sales for the period came to $1.01 billion, exceeding Wall Street’s expectations. Profit, excluding some items, was 93 cents a share, compared with the average estimate of 81 cents.
CrowdStrike also raised its guidance for revenue for the full fiscal year, to $3.92 billion to $3.93 billion. Analysts were expecting $3.9 billion.
The company also surpassed $4 billion in ending annual recurring revenue as of Oct. 31, making CrowdStrike “the fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone,” Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said in the statement.
Delta Airlines’ operations were stunted for days as a result of the outage, costing the airline at least $500 million in out-of-pocket losses, according to a lawsuit it filed against CrowdStrike in October. CrowdStrike said Delta was shifting blame “from its failure to update its antiquated IT infrastructure,” in a statement at the time.
“Following this summer’s incident as a company we were tested,” Kurtz said, in a call with investors on Tuesday. “We responded with speed, care and resolve and we focused on becoming even better.”

20241126,CRWD,"(Reuters) - Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike raised its annual revenue and profit forecasts and beat third-quarter revenue on Tuesday, betting on growing demand for cybersecurity services amid growing online threats.
Businesses are increasingly investing in Crowdstrike's comprehensive cybersecurity services to combat the widespread threat of online hacking and digital fraud.
Several companies, including AT&T, Live Nation Entertainment's Ticketmaster unit and UnitedHealth Group have been targeted by online hacking attempts this year.
Shares of Crowdstrike were down about 2% in extended trading after its fourth-quarter revenue forecast failed to impress investors.
""Despite expected headwinds from the July 19th incident. We saw incredible success with our customer commitment packages as customers embraced the program and chose to deepen their relationship with CrowdStrike,"" CFO Burt Podbere said.
CrowdStrike expects its annual revenue to be between $3.92 billion and $3.93 billion, compared with its prior expectations of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $3.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.
JP Morgan analysts said in a note ahead of the results that they expect ""reaccelaration"" of growth and profitability, despite the near-term pressure from the outage.
Similarly, rival Palo Alto Networks beat estimates for its first quarter, benefiting from robust spending in November.
CrowdStrike now expects its annual adjusted profit per share to be between $3.74 and $3.76, up from its previous estimate range of $3.61 to $3.65.

CrowdStrike shares have added about 42.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.5%.
What's Next for CrowdStrike?
While CrowdStrike has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for CrowdStrike: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, CrowdStrike grew its sales at an incredible 42.8% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth surpassed the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis.
Story Continues
CrowdStrike Quarterly Revenue
This quarter, CrowdStrike reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 28.5%, and its $1.01 billion of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 2.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 22.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.
Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow by 20.4% over the next 12 months. This projection is still healthy and implies the market sees success for its products and services.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.
Annual Recurring Revenue
While reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.
CrowdStrike’s ARR punched in at $4.02 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters, its growth was fantastic as it averaged 31.7% year-on-year increases. This performance aligned with its total sales growth and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company’s technology. Its growth also makes CrowdStrike a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.
CrowdStrike Annual Recurring Revenue
Customer Acquisition Efficiency
The customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments.
CrowdStrike is very efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 24.4 months this quarter. The company’s performance indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation. These dynamics give CrowdStrike the freedom to invest in new product initiatives while maintaining optionality.

Key Takeaways from CrowdStrike’s Q3 Results
It was great to see CrowdStrike’s positive full-year EPS guidance, which exceeded analysts’ expectations. We were also happy its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS guidance for next quarter slightly missed. Overall, this quarter had some key positives, but it wasn't perfect. The stock is up a lot recently, showing heightened expectations, and shares traded down 3.8% to $350.82 immediately after reporting.
Is CrowdStrike an attractive investment opportunity right now? What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

__________________________
1. CrowdStrike uses its GAAP provision for income taxes for the purpose of determining its non-GAAP income tax expense. The tax costs for intellectual property integration relating to acquisitions are included in the GAAP provision for income taxes. The income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles assets, including purchased patents, acquisition related expenses, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, gains and other income from strategic investments attributable to CrowdStrike, July 19 Incident related costs and (recoveries), net, and legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits included in the GAAP provision for income taxes were not material for all periods presented.
2. For periods in which CrowdStrike had diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, the sum of the impact of individual reconciling items may not total to diluted Non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders because of rounding differences.

Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to determining results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), CrowdStrike believes the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance. CrowdStrike uses the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. CrowdStrike believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these measures eliminate the effects of certain variables unrelated to CrowdStrike’s overall operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.
Other companies, including companies in CrowdStrike’s industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of CrowdStrike’s non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.
Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate CrowdStrike’s business.
Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Margin
CrowdStrike defines non-GAAP subscription gross profit and non-GAAP subscription gross margin as GAAP subscription gross profit and GAAP subscription gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of acquired intangible assets.
Non-GAAP Income from Operations
CrowdStrike defines non-GAAP income from operations as GAAP income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, and July 19 Incident related costs and (recoveries), net.
Non-GAAP Net Income Attributable to CrowdStrike
The company defines non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to CrowdStrike excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, July 19 Incident related costs and (recoveries), net, acquisition-related provision (benefit) for income taxes, losses (gains) and other income from strategic investments, and losses (gains) on deferred compensation assets.
Non-GAAP Net Income per Share Attributable to CrowdStrike Common Stockholders, Diluted
CrowdStrike defines non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, as non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that CrowdStrike defines as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software and website development costs, purchases of deferred compensation investments, and proceeds from sale of deferred compensation investments. CrowdStrike monitors free cash flow as one measure of its overall business performance, which enables CrowdStrike to analyze its future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow CrowdStrike to better understand the cash needs of its business. While CrowdStrike believes that free cash flow is useful in evaluating its business, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of free cash flow as a measure of CrowdStrike’s liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in CrowdStrike’s cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in CrowdStrike's industry, may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison.
Explanation of Operational Measures
Annual Recurring Revenue
ARR is calculated as the annualized value of CrowdStrike’s customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. To the extent that CrowdStrike is negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, CrowdStrike continues to include that revenue in ARR if CrowdStrike is actively in discussion with such an organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies CrowdStrike that it is not renewing its subscription.
Magic Number
Magic Number is calculated by performing the following calculation for the most recent four quarters and taking the average: annualizing the difference between a quarter’s Subscription Revenue and the prior quarter’s Subscription Revenue, and then dividing the resulting number by the previous quarter’s Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense. Magic Number = Average of previous four quarters: ((Quarter GAAP Subscription Revenue – Prior Quarter GAAP Subscription Revenue) x 4) / Prior Quarter Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense.
Free Cash Flow Rule of 40
Free cash flow rule of 40 is calculated by taking the current quarter total revenue year over year growth rate percentage and summing it with the current quarter free cash flow margin percentage.
Dollar-Based Gross Retention Rate
Dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end is calculated by starting with the ARR from all subscription customers as of 12 months prior to such period, or Prior Period ARR. Then deduct from the Prior Period ARR any ARR from subscription customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Remaining ARR. Then divide the total Current Period Remaining ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of ARR from all subscription customers as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn.

20241126,CRWD,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 13 Stocks in Focus. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's game plan.
Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the crucial events on Wall Street this week and emphasized the importance of watching upcoming earnings reports. He pointed out that the Thanksgiving period often brings a surge of optimism to the market. However, Cramer expressed concern that this enthusiasm is getting out of hand.
“Thanksgiving tends to unleash the animal spirits of the market in a very positive way. I’m no killjoy… but there's getting to be a little too much speculation for me and if we don't deal with it, if I don't talk about it, it's gonna become a problem.”

Cramer also turned his attention to Bitcoin, commenting on the growing buzz around the cryptocurrency. He expressed his hope that Bitcoin would finally reach the $100,000 mark so the conversation could move on. According to Cramer, the surge in Bitcoin's price is largely tied to speculation fueled by the President-elect's idea of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He noted that many people who had missed out on Bitcoin when it was trading lower are now justifying their purchases at these higher levels.
“As long as it's legal, I'm all in but understand, I have nothing to offer on Bitcoin's $100,000 price tag, nor does anybody else, by the way, except to say this: This is what happens when there are more buyers than sellers.”
Turning to broader market trends, Cramer acknowledged that stock trading tends to slow down during the rest of the holiday week. However, he highlighted that Wednesday would bring the latest personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report from the government. This report, a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve, could give a clue as to whether the Fed will consider another rate cut before the year ends.
Cramer noted that the economy has been running hotter than the Fed would prefer, which has led to speculation that a rate cut in December might not be necessary. The situation is particularly challenging, he explained, because long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, have been rising since the Fed began its rate cuts. Normally, these rates would decrease in such an environment, so if the PCE report shows a cooler inflation reading, it could fuel another rally. On the other hand, if the report is hot, Cramer suggested it could trigger a downturn in some of the more speculative stocks.

Our Methodology
For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on November 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74
Cramer said that the time is nigh to buy CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) and stated:
“After the close, we have some big tech names reporting, including some that we own for the Charitable Trust. CrowdStrike, Dell Technologies, Workday. I think we might see these go 3, 4, 3. CrowdStrike's been on a charm offensive, that’s George Kurtz, ever since that summer glitch heard around the world. I believe that CEO Kurtz has a free pass to say how the company's doing. So it might be a real good time to buy it ahead of the quarter, maybe pick some up this day.”
CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company recognized for its advanced Falcon platform, which offers a wide range of endpoint security solutions. In July, the company faced a significant IT outage due to a software glitch, causing disruption. The company swiftly addressed the issue. CEO George Kurtz mentioned during the last earnings call that while the outage delayed some contracts, most deals remain active in the sales pipeline.
CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is set to release its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 on November 26. In late August, it projected that its revenue for the third quarter would fall between $979.2 million and $984.7 million, marking a year-over-year increase of approximately 25%.
The company’s outlook for the full fiscal year 2025 is equally optimistic, with a revenue forecast ranging between $3.89 billion and $3.90 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 27% to 28% from the previous year. Additionally, management reiterated the company’s commitment to its long-term ambition of reaching $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by the end of fiscal year 2031.
Overall CRWD ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's game plan. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241126,CRWD,"Third quarter 2024 earnings season is winding down. All of the Magnificent 7 stocks have now reported earnings. However, the end of November and beginning of December will still see a slew of specialty retailers and some surprising technology juggernauts.
5 Earnings All-Stars
All five of these companies are earnings all-stars. Two have perfect 5-year earnings track records. That’s impressive given that there was a pandemic in 2020 which tripped up many companies, for obvious reasons.
The other three companies also have great earnings surprise track records, with just 1 or 2 misses over the last 5 years. That, too, is impressive given the pandemic, supply chain problems, and interest rate increases over that period.
Can these companies keep their streaks going?
5 Spectacular Earnings Charts to Finish Earnings Season
1.    Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL)
Dell Technologies has a great earnings surprise track record. It has beat 10 quarters in a row and only has one miss in the last 5 years.
Shares of Dell are rallying again. It’s up 88.4% year-to-date. But Dell is still attractively priced with a forward P/E of 18.4. Investors also get a dividend, yielding 1.2%.
Will Dell beat again?
2.    CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD)
CrowdStrike has a perfect 5-year earnings surprise track record. That’s impressive.
Shares of CrowdStrike are up 42.4% year-to-date. It’s testing the all-time highs again. CrowdStrike isn’t cheap. It has a forward P/E of 102.7.
Will CrowdStrike beat again?
3.    Salesforce, Inc. (CRM)
Salesforce also has a perfect 5-year earnings surprise track record. That’s impressive, as well. Not many companies have held onto their perfect earnings streaks given the pandemic.
Shares of Salesforce are up 29% year-to-date and breaking out to new all-time highs. Salesforce isn’t cheap, but trades with a forward P/E of 34, which is in-line with its peers.
Will Salesforce beat again?
4.    Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)
Lululemon has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2020, just after the pandemic broke out. For a retailer that had to deal with supply chain challenges, that’s an impressive streak.
Shares of Lululemon are down 36.1% year-to-date on questions about new challengers in athleisure. Lululemon is attractively priced. It trades with a forward P/E of 22.6.
Will Lululemon beat the earnings consensus again?
5.    Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA)
Ulta Beauty has only missed twice in the last 5 years. The first miss was in 2020, just after the pandemic hit. But the second miss was last quarter. It’s still, however, an impressive record.
Story Continues
Shares of Ulta Beauty have tanked this year, falling 26% year-to-date. But Ulta Beauty is cheap, with a forward P/E of 14.7. Berkshire Hathaway bought, and then sold, shares of Ulta Beauty earlier this year.
Will Ulta Beauty turn it around and beat this quarter?

20241126,CRWD,"Nvidia (NVDA)
Shares in chipmaker Nvidia fell 4% in the previous session, seeing it lose its title as the world's most valuable company, pulling it back into second place behind Apple (AAPL).
Monday's fall in shares left Nvidia with a market valuation of $3.3tn (£2.6tn) compared to Apple's $3.5tn.
The stock declined following reports that Nvidia executive Jay Puri had met with China's vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen.

Wang said China welcomed Nvidia's presence and hoped to develop a better business environment for foreign firms, according to reports by Reuters.
The meeting comes as US president Joe Biden's administration is set to announce new export restrictions on China, which includes further curbing access to semiconductors.
Nvidia's shares were nearly 3% in the red over a five-day period, as the company's closely-watched earnings disappointed on revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins.

Apple (AAPL)
Apple was also slightly in the red in pre-market trading on Tuesday, as a Financial Times report highlighted the difficulties that the tech company was facing in China with the rollout of its AI model for iPhones and other products.
A top Beijing official reportedly warned that foreign companies like Apple would face a ""difficult and long process"" for approvals unless they partnered with local groups.

Apple CEO Tim Cook arrived in China on Monday and joined more than 20 business leaders in talks with China's premier, according to Bloomberg.
This marked Cook's third trip to China this year and was reportedly the first high-level meeting between foreign corporations and a senior Beijing official since Donald Trump's US presidential election victory earlier this month.
Trump had already threatened to hike trade tariffs with China in his election campaign and on Monday vowed to impose even deeper tariffs on China after he returns to office in January.

Shares in video conferencing provider Zoom were down nearly 6% in pre-market trading on Tuesday, after the company shared a sales forecast that failed to excite investors.
Zoom guided to total revenue of between $1.175bn and $1.18bn for the fourth quarter, which was only slightly higher than analyst estimates of $1.17bn, according to Bloomberg.

Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""Halfords’ results show a business stuck in the slow lane. Make no mistake, the jump in its share price does not reflect a business in perfect health. This is simply a relief rally that full-year earnings guidance hasn’t changed.""

20241126,CRWD,"We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.
With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.
Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.
Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that ""it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions."" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to ""prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.""
To prove that ""equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,"" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that ""market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House."" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.
Story Continues
The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.
Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank ""urges caution"" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.
Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'
Between then and now, the bank believes that ""generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage."" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms ""building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.""
While generative AI might be in the ""trough of disillusionment,"" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the ""overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032"" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.
Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.
However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.
According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is ""more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud."" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.
Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.
Our Methodology
To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)
Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 32%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69
CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity products and services provider whose Falcon system was at the heart of one of the biggest IT outages earlier this year. Its shares are down 9% since the blackout and have gained 53% since the post-outage bottom. The recovery in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s stock is based on shifting investor attitudes about the firm's subscription revenue and legal implications stemming from the outage. As few legal troubles and customer switching surface, investors are slowly creeping back to CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s stock. However, the firm is continuing to face pressure from Delta Airlines because of the outage as the two companies have sued each other. Apart from the implications of the outage, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s $10 billion recurring revenue guidance for 2031 and a midpoint free cash flow margin guidance of 36% will continue to drive its margin due to the central role that the metrics play in any software company's hypothesis.
Baron Funds mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cloud-architected SaaS cybersecurity vendor offering endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Shares continued their strong performance from the first quarter and were again a top contributor, rising 19.5% in the second quarter on better execution than peers in the broader security space. The company reported strong quarterly results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by customers consolidating their cybersecurity spend on CrowdStrike with free cash flow margins reaching 35%. With accelerating market share gains in its core endpoint detection and response offering, emerging products including Cloud, Identity, and SIEM reaching material scale, and newer products in data protection and AI ramping quickly, net new annual recurring revenue and total revenue look to sustain a long duration of growth. With its leading competitive positioning in cybersecurity, the growing threat landscape (which is also driven by the advancements in AI, making hackers more dangerous), its unique lightweight, single-agent, architecture, and its platform approach, we retain conviction in CrowdStrike, which is emerging as the security platform to beat in terms of scale, profitability, and free cash flow conversion.”
Overall CRWD ranks 4th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

""Similar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc.

With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.""

20241126,AVGO,"We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.
On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.
Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.
First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.
Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.
Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.
Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

Oaktree Capital’s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos
In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.
Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.
Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.
On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.
The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

20241126,AVGO,"While Nvidia (NVDA) continues dominating the AI chip market, investors seek additional opportunities in the rapidly evolving sector. Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations.
Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry.
Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options.
Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: ""It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software — and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.""

Chicago, IL – November 22, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of Stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Merck & Co., Inc. MRK, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM and Natural Health Trends Corp. NHTC.
Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:
Top Analyst Reports for Broadcom, Merck and Qualcomm
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Broadcom’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company’s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.
However, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom’s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.
(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)
Merck’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.
Yet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.
(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)
Shares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.
Story Continues
Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.
However, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space. The company formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions.
(You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)
Shares of Natural Health Trends have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+1.8% vs. +21.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, a declining active member base remains the biggest concern for the company. It faces liquidity challenges and high operating expenses. Dependency on key markets and intense competition pose additional risks.
However, expansion into new markets and improvement in cost management bode well.

20241126,AVGO,"Investor confidence in certain major companies has propelled markets higher, but there are also those betting against big-name stocks through short selling amid continued uncertainty.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly topped the 6,000-point mark in the recent rally following Donald Trump's election win, though they have since eased back, with the main US index closing Wednesday's session flat at 5,917.
While markets broadly rose following the US election, there were a particular group of stocks that rallied in what has been dubbed the ""Trump trade"", around expectations as to the policies that the Republican president-elect could look to implement after he returns to the White House in January.
One of which was Tesla (TSLA), as the electric carmaker's CEO Elon Musk was a major supporter of Trump's campaign and has since been nominated by the president-elect to co-lead the recently announced Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The post-election rally in Tesla stock pushed its market valuation to over the $1tn mark, which was welcome news for investors that are bullish about the company's prospects.
However, not all investors were reaping the benefits, as data from S3 Partners showed that short-sellers had lost nearly $8bn by the Monday after the election, according to Business Insider.
Unlike the traditional way of investing in markets by buying shares with the goal of selling them at a higher price, also known as going ""long"", short selling aims to make a profit on the declining price of the stock. An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.
The hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.
And while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.
Analysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in the last month.
Here are the major companies that have become popular shorts.
Popular short stocks
S3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.
Story continues
Chipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.
The demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.
At the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.
Shares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.
And Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.

The discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.
Tesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.
However, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve ""slight growth"" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.
S3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).
Following its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.
S&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this ""may be related to the [US] election"".
They said that despite this significant activity in ""all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses"".
Global short bets
Meanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.
The data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on ""crowdedness"", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors’ supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.
LVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.
The company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an ""uncertain economic and geopolitical environment"" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.

The luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.
Kering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.
Shares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.
Multinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.
Diageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.
It has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.
In South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.

Hindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were ""nothing but a lie"".
On Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.
Shares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.
In a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were ""baseless"".
Hindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.
However, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.

20241126,AVGO,"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?
When Is Debt A Problem?
Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.
Check out our latest analysis for Broadcom
How Much Debt Does Broadcom Carry?
The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2024 Broadcom had debt of US$69.9b, up from US$39.3b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.95b in cash leading to net debt of about US$59.9b.
NasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History November 21st 2024
How Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?
We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Broadcom had liabilities of US$19.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.95b in cash and US$6.22b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$86.1b.
Of course, Broadcom has a titanic market capitalization of US$772.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.
In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).
Story Continues
Broadcom's debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.1 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 9.0% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Broadcom's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.
Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Broadcom actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.
Our View
When it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Broadcom was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Broadcom is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.

As NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market—and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO).
What To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry.
Broadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers—critical components for Nvidia’s AI-focused operations.

A strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook.
Historically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia’s during major market reactions. Nvidia’s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes.
How To Buy AVGO Stock
By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.
Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.
If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

20241126,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.
With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.
Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.
Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that ""it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions."" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to ""prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.""
To prove that ""equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,"" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that ""market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House."" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.
Story Continues
The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.
Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank ""urges caution"" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.
Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'
Between then and now, the bank believes that ""generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage."" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms ""building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.""
While generative AI might be in the ""trough of disillusionment,"" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the ""overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032"" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.
Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.
However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.
According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is ""more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud."" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.
Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.
Our Methodology
To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.
Polen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“In the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.”
Overall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241126,NOW,"Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)
What a fantastic six months it’s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.
Is now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it’s free.
Why Is NOW a Good Business?
Founded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.
1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In
While reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.
ServiceNow’s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters, its year-on-year growth averaged 24.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company’s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.
ServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue
2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable
Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.
Sell-side analysts expect ServiceNow’s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.
3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains
One of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company’s products and services over time.
ServiceNow’s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would’ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn’t win any new customers over the last 12 months.
ServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate
ServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.

20241126,NOW,"We recently published a list of 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news.
Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.
“Just to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we’ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get—very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they’ve trained haven’t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, “There is no wall,” so maybe it’s not an issue—we’ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.”
However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.
“I think if you take a longer-term view—2 to 4 years—we’re still very confident we’ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn’t mean there won’t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we’ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.”

Needham raised the firm’s price target on ServiceNow (NOW) to $1,150 from $1,075 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after hosting the company for a group investor meeting last week. The size of the calendar year 2025 Renewal cohort is larger than previous years, which is expected to pressure current remaining performance obligation growth through the first nine months of theyear until customers renew in Q4, with a potential upside catalyst to the renewal cycle as customers migrate to Xanadu which includes GenAI capabilities and the Pro Plus SKU, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Additionally, Needham says Pro Plus pricing seems to be tracking in line, if not ahead of management’s targeted ~30% uplift, and Subscription Gross Margin is likely to see pressure next year.

20241126,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks.
As the “AI arms race” continues to evolve, countries are increasingly beginning to realize the efforts they need to expend to stay relevant. One such country in the picture that’s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.

The remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do ""everything they can to lock their digital doors"" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.
""While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it"".
McFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.
In other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.
The search, which started on November 1st took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it “cannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs’ copied articles were used to build [OpenAI’s] models”.
Story Continues
“News plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week’s worth of its experts’ and lawyers’ work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today”.
OpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78
ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.
On November 25, Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained a “Buy” rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and a $1,150.00 price target. Key factors noted during a recent investor meeting have led to this buy rating. A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities. Another factor adding to the positive outlook is the disciplined approach to Pro Plus (the company's new generative AI SKU) pricing. The pressure on the Subscription Gross Margin in the coming year has already been factored into the analysis.
Overall NOW ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

20241126,NOW,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.
In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.
However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Our proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.
Story Continues
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.
Bottom Line
ServiceNow has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that ServiceNow is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

20241126,NOW,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.
View our latest analysis for ServiceNow
What's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?
ServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.
Can we expect growth from ServiceNow?
NYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

20241126,NOW,"ServiceNow stock (NOW) has been on a roll recently, boasting over 55% one-year returns, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500. While many are still bullish on further upside in the stock, we believe it's time to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the profits.
ServiceNow specializes in digital workflow automation, providing cloud-based workflow automation solutions that help organizations improve their operations. Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.
The company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.
Hard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage
The rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.
Approximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.
Some of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.
Our bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft’s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.
Carahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn’t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company’s future relations with the government.
In a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.
This also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn’t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock’s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.

20241126,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Shaping Wall Street Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street today.
In recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.
""We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously”
Helberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.

This news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a “wall”. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI’s Orion is “so far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI’s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.”
However, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is “no wall”. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it’s possible to have reached a turning point.
“We haven’t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we’ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.”
Gary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:
“The economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense…”
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

20241126,NOW,"ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
ROE can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:
14% = US$1.3b ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.
What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
ServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE
To start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.
NYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.
Story Continues
Is ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?
ServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Conclusion
On the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

20241126,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:
“When it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.”
READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks
Cramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.
Another sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.
While some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.
Similarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they’re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.
As for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they’ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.

“We need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we’re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.”

Cramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.’s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:
“Let's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive… Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market… Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting… Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again… Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions.

Sovereign AI: a new concept gaining traction in the realm of artificial intelligence. As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing “sovereign” artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to “codify” a country’s culture, history, and collective intelligence.

That said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent’s competitiveness and technological resilience.
Filippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they “understand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.”
“As this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.”
While AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.
Latest Advancements in AI
In recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon’s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe’s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world’s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.
“WoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification”.

Other fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.
In other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed “Operator”, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. The planned release is part of a wider industry movement towards agents—AI software capable of performing multi-step tasks for users with minimal oversight.

20241126,NOW,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Jim Cramer's stocks.
Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed Tuesday’s market action, noting that the rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory temporarily slowed down as Wall Street begins to assess the potential effects of broad tax cuts on the bond market. Cramer pointed out that while the stock market typically reacts positively to tax cuts, there’s a catch.
“What if the Treasury doesn’t have the money? Then just like everybody else, the government has to borrow to make up the difference and it borrows by selling bonds, trillions, trillions of dollars worth of bonds.”
READ ALSO Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks and Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins
Even though these tax cuts have not yet materialized, Cramer observed that the bond market seems to be sending a warning signal. He asked whether the country could face an interest rate reckoning if it borrows too much, and pointed out that this is a concern on many minds right now. Cramer continued by suggesting that perhaps investors have been too focused on the stock market rally, putting the cart before the horse, with the horse being the bond market.
Cramer acknowledged that stocks have surged since Trump’s election, but the rally has been uneven. While many investors expect tax cuts across the board—on corporate income, individual income, and capital gains—no one is exactly sure what form these cuts will take. However, it’s widely anticipated that overall taxes will be lower. Cramer noted:
“If it’s at all like 2016 when Trump first became president, the wealthy will be the biggest beneficiaries. And when rich people get more money, the theory goes they invest in stocks, create new businesses… It has always worked for the stock market.”
But Cramer warned that there’s another side to the equation: the bond market. On Tuesday, it became clear that investors in bonds were reacting nervously to the possibility of unfunded tax cuts. Interest rates surged across all maturities, signaling a shift in sentiment. Cramer emphasized that when you look at how large and fast the bond market’s move has been, it highlights a critical concern: the federal government is already borrowing trillions of dollars from the bond market, and this is happening before any tax cuts have even taken effect. He explored the possibility that this is why the bond market is responding so negatively, making it more difficult for the stock market to keep climbing at the same pace.
Story Continues
“If you believe we’re about to get big tax cuts, remember that somebody eventually has to pay for the missing tax receipts, as boring as that is, even if that means the government borrows a lot more money, causing bond yields to spike. We can only hope the stock market goes back to ignoring long-term interest rates or that those rates come back down in response to some benign inflation numbers.”

How ServiceNow Inc (NOW)’s AI Partnerships Are Driving Its Soaring Growth: Insights from Jim Cramer
A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.
ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)
Talking about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) on Tuesday, Cramer said:
“As is always the case, there are pockets of positivity that seem immune to the tug of the bond market, at least for most of the session. After showing immense love for the semiconductors, disdain for the software companies, for most of the year, the game is reversed. The Adobes and ServiceNows and Microsofts soared today. Doesn’t make a lot of sense and… we’re getting worrisome parabolic moves in many of these stocks.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a comprehensive platform for digital businesses, providing solutions for workflow automation, AI, machine learning, IT service management, and various other enterprise applications. In the third quarter, it placed significant emphasis on its strategic partnerships, which have played a key role in expanding the company’s AI capabilities. The company deepened its collaboration with Nvidia, aiming to accelerate the adoption of Nvidia’s Agentic AI within enterprise environments.
This partnership, along with others with Siemens and Zoom Video Communications, strengthens its ability to integrate advanced AI solutions into its platform, enhancing its value proposition across various industries.
For the full year 2024, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has projected subscription revenue to reach between $10.655 billion and $10.66 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23%. This is a slight increase from its previous guidance of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion, which had represented expected growth of around 22%. The company also expects a gross profit margin of 84.5% for its subscription services, with an operating income margin of 29.5% and a free cash flow margin of 31%.
Overall, NOW ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stocks.

20241127,META,"(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump had dinner with Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Wednesday.

Zuckerberg met with Trump and members of his team, according to a Meta representative, who added that the session took place at a crucial time for US innovation. The representative didn’t detail what was discussed but added that Zuckerberg wasn’t staying for Thanksgiving.
The Facebook founder and other technology executives have been the target of blistering criticism from Republican lawmakers and commentators who said the major platforms had censored conservative views, an accusation the companies denied.
Zuckerberg and Trump have had a contentious relationship over the years, which became more intense after Facebook banned the then-president in January 2021 in the wake of the attack on the US Capitol.
Trump later suggested he might even try to imprison Zuckerberg over accusations he had interfered in the 2020 election.
Earlier: Meta’s Zuckerberg Calls Trump Response to Shooting ‘Badass’
Meta reinstated Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in early 2023. After the July attempted assassination on Trump in Pennsylvania, Zuckerberg said in an interview with Bloomberg that “seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Zuckerberg spoke to Trump by telephone this fall, and posted a congratulatory note after he won the election earlier this month.
“We do not comment on reports of private meetings that did or did not occur,” Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said when asked about the Wednesday meeting. But Stephen Miller, an adviser to the president-elect, confirmed to Fox News that Trump and Zuckerberg had met.

AI companies in the United States, many of whom have extensive business relations in China, are waiting anxiously for President-elect Donald Trump to assume office and announce possible changes to American policies towards China that will provide greater clarity on future US trade with the Asian country. Top executives from US-based firms were in China recently to meet with Chinese business leaders amid rumors of a massive spike in tariffs on goods being imported to Washington from Beijing.

Per the report, billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly backed Trump during the 2024 election and is rumored to have a key influence over the President-elect on AI policy, will not be the AI czar. However, the report adds that Musk is nevertheless expected to be involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases related to AI. xAI, the AI startup Musk founded in 2023, recently raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. xAI is competing with OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker with a valuation of more than $157 billion.

A latest report into the adoption of AI in the United Kingdom has revealed that even though a lot of companies are using AI, only a few have integrated the new technology into their manufacturing processes. The study, called The Future Factories was carried out earlier this year in collaboration with design software giant Autodesk. The report warns that the lack of confidence in digital technologies and AI means companies in the UK are at risk of missing out on innovation and productivity gains. It also proposes how government initiatives and regulation can support the adoption of new technologies.

The report further highlights that manufacturers were mostly using AI to manage their energy usage and reduce waste. It added that some of the manufacturing sectors in which AI was being used were predictive maintenance and supply chain optimization. Per a survey cited in the study, the biggest benefits manufacturers cited were increased efficiency, improved productivity, and automation of routine tasks. The research highlights that the benefits show the importance of lowering the barrier to entry for these technologies and the untapped potential in this field for small manufacturers.

Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.
“Just to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we’ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get—very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they’ve trained haven’t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, “There is no wall,” so maybe it’s not an issue—we’ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.”
However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.
“I think if you take a longer-term view—2 to 4 years—we’re still very confident we’ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn’t mean there won’t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we’ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.”

“Meta came out, had solid results, but they always guide conservatively in the September quarter for the outlook, and the stock sold off, which is what we expected it to do.”
Despite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg’s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).
According to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta’s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600.
Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.”

Latest reports suggest that the United Kingdom is launching a Laboratory for AI Security Research (LASR) to strengthen national security and cyber defense in response to evolving threats in the AI arms race. Backed by an initial £8.22 million in government funding, LASR will unite industry, academia, and government experts to explore the impact of AI on security. This initiative complements the UK’s broader cybersecurity strategy, including the upcoming Cyber Security and Resilience Bill and the designation of data centers as critical infrastructure.

The laboratory will adopt a catalytic model to attract further investment and collaboration. The announcement follows heightened global concerns about state actors leveraging AI for malicious purposes, such as North Korea’s use of AI for cyberattacks. Additionally, the UK government has also unveiled a £1 million incident response initiative to bolster allied cyber defense capabilities, highlighting AI’s dual potential as both a security risk and a tool for good.

20241127,META,"Mark your calendars: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is heading to court on April 14, 2025, and the stakes couldn't be higher. The FTC is accusing the tech giant of throwing its weight around by overpaying for Instagram and WhatsApp to crush emerging competition instead of, you know, competing fairly. This showdown is about more than just old acquisitionsit's a battle over whether antitrust laws can keep up with the breakneck speed of today's tech landscape.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.
Judge James Boasberg isn't making it easy for the FTC, though. While he's allowing the trial to move forward, he's already flagged serious challenges with their case. Meta's defense? The market has changed. Rivals like TikTok, YouTube of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and LinkedIn of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are thriving, so calling them a monopoly feels like reaching. But the FTC isn't backing down, arguing Meta's dominance in personal social networks didn't happen by chanceit happened by design.
For investors, this trial is the ultimate watch-and-wait game. If the FTC scores a win, it could shake up how Big Tech does business, especially when it comes to mergers and acquisitions. But if Meta prevails, it might reinforce the company's grip on the digital ecosystem and set a new benchmark for how far regulators can push antitrust cases. Either way, April 2025 isn't just a court dateit's a moment that could reshape the rules of the tech game for years to come.

Large language models power AI chatbots and they are the hottest items on Wall Street these days. Several hyperscalers have launched their own LLMs and chatbots in the past few months. Any updates related to these chatbots are followed eagerly by analysts. Anthropic, an AI startup that developed the Claude AI model, recently proposed a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the data that powers them. The startup claims that the system, called the Model Context Protocol, which is open source, would help AI models produce better and more relevant responses to queries.

In a blog post, the AI startup underlined that as AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. However, the post added, even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data — trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Anthropic claims that MCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications.

20241127,AAPL,"(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google is asking a federal appeals court to throw out a ruling in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games that would force the search giant to overhaul its Play mobile app store.

Google said in a filing Wednesday that US District Judge James Donato’s ruling is mistaken and asked that the outcome of the long-running litigation be set aside.
For one thing, Google argued, Donato should have recognized that the company competes with Apple Inc. in the smartphone market, as a different judge found when she concluded that Apple’s conduct toward Epic didn’t violate federal antitrust laws. The judge also erred in holding a trial with a jury last year instead of deciding himself whether Google acted anticompetitively, the company said. Google says Donato’s ruling would force it to do business with rival app stores — which the company contends it is not legally required to do.
Google’s appeal is “meritless” and relies on “flawed arguments,” a spokeswoman for Epic said in a statement. “We will fight to ensure that the jury’s verdict and the court’s injunction are upheld and Google is held to account for its anticompetitive behavior.”
A San Francisco jury concluded in December 2023 that Google violated antitrust law by blocking rival app stores through a series of revenue-sharing agreements with mobile device makers like Samsung. Following up with a fix in October, Donato ordered Google to allow developers to set up app marketplaces and offer consumers billing options other than its own payment system.
“This case involves an extraordinary attempt by a lone competitor to use the federal judiciary to restructure the day-to-day operations of Google’s app store, Google Play, and to unilaterally reshape markets with consequences for millions of non-parties,”Google said in its filing. The jury verdict and Donato’s injunction, unless reversed, “will directly undercut Google’s efforts” to compete against Apple, Google said.
Epic first sued Google and Apple in August 2020, accusing them of blocking competition for rival app stores. The judge in the Apple case largely ruled against Epic, though she directed the iPhone maker to make some changes to its App Store rules. Epic and Apple are currently fighting in an Oakland federal court over whether the iPhone maker is abiding by that ruling.
Story Continues
Donato has temporarily put his ruling on hold. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco can extend that delay pending the outcome of Google’s appeal, or force Google to make changes to its business while simultaneously seeking to overturn the ruling.
Oral arguments are scheduled on Feb. 3 at the Ninth Circuit.

20241127,AAPL,"It’s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you’re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both.
My advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.
Here are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you’re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.
Video games
Video games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You’ll find deals on consoles including Sony’s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo’s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I’m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.

Discounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve’s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.
Headphones
Whether you’re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple’s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you’re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.

It’s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can’t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you’re into.
You’ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.
Laptops
In the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You’re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple’s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft’s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That’s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.
Story Continues
Generally, when you’re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That’s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they’ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.
TVs
TVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don’t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.
When it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you’re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.
Televisions are displayed for sale ahead of Black Friday at a Walmart Supercenter on Nov. 14, 2023, in Burbank, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) · Mario Tama via Getty Images
If there’s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it’s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don’t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you’re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG’s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.
Phones and tablets
If you’re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you’re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you’ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.
Tablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they’re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.
Smart speakers and streaming devices
Amazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.
Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku’s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google’s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I’ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.

20241127,AAPL,"Most consumers do not give Apple (AAPL, Financials) devices as holiday gifts, a survey from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners reveals.
Based on the Christmas season of last year, the poll revealed that only a tiny portion of participants presented an Apple gift. Of those who did, Apple Watch and iPad were the most probable items given; iPhones and Mac PCs were seldom picked.
According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners' Wednesday findings, 9% of Apple Watch customers received the watch as a gift while 6% of iPad owners got the tablet. On the other hand, only around 1% of Mac or iPhone users said they had received such as presents.
""iPhones are an unlikely gift, as the phone is just the beginning before someone (presumably the recipient) becomes responsible for ongoing mobile carrier charges,"" CIRP said. ""Giving an iPhone as a gift is kind of like giving someone a puppy. Mac computers are also rarely gifted. They are both expensive and personal, often needing to meet specific needs.""
With the introduction of iOS 18.2, which will have more Apple Intelligence capabilities, financial companies had predicted a possible increase in Apple iPhone sales this quarter. CIRP's results, however, imply that although iPads and Apple Watches enjoy a little increase throughout the season, iPhones and Mac computers are not very popular alternatives for Christmas presents.

20241127,AAPL,"Apple (AAPL, Financials) and its competitors are projected to ship approximately 1.24 billion smartphones globally in 2024, marking a 6.2% year-over-year increase, research firm International Data Corporation said.
After two years of declines, pent-up demand for gadget improvements spurred the turnabout.
With 2.6% CAGR from 2023 to 2028, growth is expected to slow down to low single digits from 2025 ahead. The company ascribed the drop to longer replacement cycles, saturation of the smartphone market, and competition from a growing secondhand smartphone industry.
Though behind Android's 7.6%, Apple's iOS is predicted to rise 0.4% in 2024. But iOS is expected to rise 3.1% year over year in 2025, surpassing Android's 1.7% increase.
With an average selling price of more than $1,000, Apple tops the sector in profitability according to IDC; Android competitors average $295.
""While GenAI continues to be a hot topic and top priority for many vendors, it is yet to impact demand significantly and drive early upgrades,"" said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Track.
""While we continue to believe GenAI will revolutionize the user experience in the years to come, more investments are needed to increase consumer awareness and introduce a must have feature that will rush consumers to the store and create that super cycle which everyone is waiting for. For now, we expect GenAI smartphones will take their place in premium flagship devices and keep moving down in price tiers to rapidly grow to 70% of the smartphone market by 2028.
Popal said generative AI-enabled smartphones would surpass premium devices and account for 70% of the market by 2028.
Apple's historic success is due to emerging countries like India, but it confronts problems in China, the US, and Europe.
Chinese manufacturers are transitioning from foldable handsets to generative AI smartphones, according to IDC's research director Anthony Scarsella. Foldables fell 7.4% in Q3 despite important vendor introductions. Scarsella said the category is predicted to expand 10.5% in 2024 and double-digit growth through 2028, with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 15.9%. Durability and restricted use cases impede foldable adoption, he said.
Despite challenges, Apple's 2025 iOS growth trajectory suggests smartphone market gains.

20241127,AAPL,"How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday.
Apple is reportedly changing its approach to software updates. The tech giant appears to be opting for staggered rollouts of new features instead of bundling everything into annual iOS releases.
In his latest weekly “Power On” newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said that Cupertino plans a significant update with iOS 18.4 this spring.
With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.43%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).

This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.
‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest TODAY for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.
So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?
To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,410,360 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $282,072 or around 1,200 shares.
To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).
Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.
How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.
For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).
Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.
AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.9% to close at $235.06 on Tuesday.

20241127,AAPL,"We recently published a list of 15 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI news that broke the internet.
OpenAI has been making headlines in the artificial intelligence realm ever since its existence, and it seems the company has something new to share almost every day. However, not all the news surrounding the company is positive. In the latest news shared by The Washington Post, OpenAI has suspended access to its latest, highly anticipated video generation tool, Sora. This suspension followed a small group of artists who had leaked access to the tool to protest the treatment they’ve been receiving at the company.

Arguing that the company used them as “PR Puppets” without pay, the artists created a webpage allowing anyone to make AI videos using Sora. OpenAI granted hundreds of artists free access to the video generation tool so that they could test out the new artificial intelligence video generator. However, 20 of these artists argued that the company had taken advantage of their unpaid labor. This is what the group of artists wrote on Hugging Face, an open-source repository for artificial intelligence projects.
“Hundreds of artists provide unpaid labor through bug testing, feedback and experimental work for the program for a $150B valued company”.
The artists further added that the opportunities offered in return for helping the company, such as being selected to have their Sora-created films screened, offer “minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives. The tool was public three hours before it was shut down. OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said that the company has temporarily shut down user access to Sora while it looks into the situation.
“Hundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora’s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards. Participation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool.”
In other news, Axios reported that President-elect Donald Trump is considering naming an ""AI czar"" in the White House that will be coordinating federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence. While Elon Musk isn’t going to be the AI czar, he is expected to be involved.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been facing problems with releasing its artificial intelligence models for iPhones and other products in China. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently begun leveraging Apple Intelligence, its AI-driven personal system, to enhance its devices and services worldwide. Meanwhile, a top Beijing official has warned that foreign companies will continue to face problems to win approvals regarding deployment of AI technologies unless they partner with local groups. Monday, November 25th marked Tim Cook’s third visit to China as the company tries to navigate the complex landscape of the country, aiming to bring Apple Intelligence to the devices sold in the country. Cook also visited China in October, acknowledging the country’s complicated regulations. He stated that there is a specific regulatory process behind this and that the company needs to complete it.

While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

20241127,AAPL,"Wednesday premarket trading saw Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock in the red, following fresh China data showing a sharp fall in foreign-branded smartphone sales in October.
The China Academy of Information and Communications Technology estimates that in October sales of foreign-branded cellphones dropped 44.25% year over year to 6.22 million units. The reduction had especially effect Apple, the biggest foreign smartphone manufacturer in China.
China is still one of Apple's key markets; in its most recent quarter, the Greater China regionincluding Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macaugenerated $15.03 billion in revenue, down from $15.08 billion a year earlier. The Cupertino, California-based corporation is also negotiating difficulties introducing artificial intelligence devices into China. A senior Chinese official recently said that unless they form partnerships with local businesses, Western enterprises must deal with protracted approval procedures.
Apple is apparently in talks about possible AI alliances with companies including Baidu (BIDU) and ByteDance (BDNCE). Apple's second-largest overseas market is still under development, hence the company has not commented on the data as it is still addressing regulatory and competitiveness challenges.

20241127,AAPL,"Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) experienced a significant decline in iPhone sales in China this October, with foreign-branded smartphones, including the iPhone, recording a 44.25% year-on-year drop. Data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) revealed that overall imports of foreign-manufactured smartphones fell to 6.22 million units, compared to 11.15 million in October 2023.
Apple's iPhone 16 series, released in September, did decent sales worldwide. Still, it underperformed in China since the unveiling of its AI capability specifically for the Chinese market was done later. While the platform's popularity benefited from certain features, the absence of a local AI partner diminished its appeal. Beijing recently tightened regulations regarding foreign-developed AI models and now requires them to partner with Chinese companies like Baidu.
Nonetheless, the cumulative sales of cellular phones in China rose 1.8% during October, reaching 29.67 million units, showing that domestic consumers crave locally manufactured mobile phones. This transition also points to a stronger branding of indigenous competitors in the world's biggest smartphone market.
Apple really feels the heat in the Chinese market due to increasing competition and changing customer trends, which is quite a test of Apple's market position in China. Whether Apple is capable of regaining the lost ground in this essential market depends on the performance of its AI-dedicated features in 2025 and cooperation with local parties.

20241127,AMZN,"(Reuters) -E-commerce giant Amazon has developed new generative artificial intelligence (AI) that can process images and videos in addition to text, making it less reliant on AI startup Anthropic, The Information reported on Wednesday.
The development of the new AI model will help Amazon reduce its reliance on Anthropic's Claude chatbot, a popular offering on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the report said, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.
The new large language model (LLM), code-named Olympus, will be able to understand scenes in images and videos and help customers search for specific scenes, such as a winning basketball shot, using simple text prompts, according to the report.
Last week, Amazon invested an additional $4 billion into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, mirroring a $4 billion investment made last year in September to capitalize on generative AI technology.
Amazon may announce Olympus as soon as next week at the annual AWS re:Invent customer conference, the Information added, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Amazon did not respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular business hours.
The online retailer has been seeking to counter a perception that its competitors Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI have taken a lead in developing generative AI.

20241127,AMZN,"It’s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you’re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both.
My advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.
Here are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you’re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.
Video games
Video games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You’ll find deals on consoles including Sony’s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo’s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I’m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.

Discounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve’s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.
Headphones
Whether you’re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple’s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you’re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.

It’s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can’t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you’re into.
You’ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.
Laptops
In the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You’re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple’s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft’s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That’s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.
Story Continues
Generally, when you’re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That’s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they’ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.
TVs
TVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don’t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.
When it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you’re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.

If there’s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it’s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don’t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you’re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG’s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.
Phones and tablets
If you’re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you’re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you’ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.
Tablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they’re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.
Smart speakers and streaming devices
Amazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.
Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku’s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google’s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I’ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.

20241127,AMZN,"Amazon (AMZN) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, AMZN crossed above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.
The 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.
Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.
Shares of AMZN have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 8.9%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, suggesting that AMZN could be poised for a continued surge.
The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account AMZN's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 16 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.
Investors may want to watch AMZN for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.

20241127,AMZN,"Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up by a considerable 21% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Amazon.com's ROE.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com
How Is ROE Calculated?
The formula for return on equity is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:
19% = US$50b ÷ US$259b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.19 in profit.
What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
Amazon.com's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE
To begin with, Amazon.com seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 23%. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.
As a next step, we compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 15% in the same period.
NasdaqGS:AMZN Past Earnings Growth November 27th 2024
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is AMZN fairly valued?

Large language models power AI chatbots and they are the hottest items on Wall Street these days. Several hyperscalers have launched their own LLMs and chatbots in the past few months. Any updates related to these chatbots are followed eagerly by analysts. Anthropic, an AI startup that developed the Claude AI model, recently proposed a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the data that powers them. The startup claims that the system, called the Model Context Protocol, which is open source, would help AI models produce better and more relevant responses to queries.

In a blog post, the AI startup underlined that as AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. However, the post added, even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data — trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Anthropic claims that MCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications.

Achieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.

Netflix (NFLX)
Netflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. The company evolved from a small DVD-rental provider to a dominant streaming service provider, courtesy of its wide-ranging content portfolio and a fortified international footprint. At the end of the second quarter of 2024, the company had 277.65 million paid subscribers globally.
NFLX boasts a Momentum Style Score of B and VGM Score of B, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Shares of Netflix has seen some interesting price action recently; the stock is up 0.2% over the past one week and up 14.9% over the past four weeks. And in the last one-year period, NFLX has gained 82.2%. As for the stock's trading volume, 3,216,937 shares on average were traded over the last 20 days.
A company's earnings performance is important for momentum investors as well. For fiscal 2024, 12 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for NFLX, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.70 to $19.78 per share. NFLX also boasts an average earnings surprise of 5.7%.
NFLX should be on investors' short list because of its impressive earnings fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Momentum and VGM Style Scores.

For instance, the price of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock is up an impressive 185% over the last five years. It's also good to see the share price up 28% over the last quarter.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.

There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Over half a decade, Netflix managed to grow its earnings per share at 41% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 23% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

A Different Perspective
It's good to see that Netflix has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 82% in the last twelve months. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 23%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.

20241127,NFLX,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Netflix won the dismissal on Tuesday of a shareholder lawsuit accusing the streaming company of downplaying the impact on subscriber growth of account sharing, where paying members share user names and passwords with nonpaying members in other households.
The proposed class action led by a Texas-based trustee began after Netflix revealed in April 2022 it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the prior quarter, the first decline in a decade, and might lose 2 million more in the next three months.
Netflix blamed the decline on several factors, including account sharing, rising competition and a shutdown of service in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Its shares fell 35% the next day, wiping out more than $54 billion of market value.
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in Oakland, California, however, said Netflix's earlier claims to be ""roughly 60% penetrated"" in the United States and Canada with ""a lot of headroom"" to grow were not false or misleading, because they referred to paid subscribers and did not imply that growth was certain.
He also found no proof Netflix concealed any determination that account sharing would severely hinder growth.
""At most,"" he said, the plaintiff's allegations suggest that the Los Gatos, California-based company investigated account sharing and found it to be ""one potential threat to growth among many.""
Lawyers for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Netflix and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Tigar had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit in January. Tuesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the plaintiff Fiyyaz Pirani, the trustee of Imperium Irrevocable Trust, cannot amend his complaint again.
The case is Pirani v Netflix Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-02672. (This story has been refiled to change the location of the judge to Oakland, California, from San Francisco, in paragraph 4)

20241127,NFLX,"Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share, indicating a change of +99.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $19.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.64 indicates a change of +19.5% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. For the current and next fiscal years, $38.91 billion and $43.84 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +12.7% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Netflix reported revenues of $9.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $3.73 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.6%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.
Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Netflix is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

A growing number of analysts are calling for the streaming giant's shares to soon trade in the quadruple digits.
On Wednesday, Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak raised his price target on Netflix to a Street high of $1,100 a share, implying over 20% upside based on current trading levels of around $900.

Wall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $800 a share, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.
One of the main catalysts for the recent price target boosts is the company's continued foray into live events, with the most recent boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson attracting over 108 million global viewers last weekend to become the most-streamed sporting event of all time.
For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers.
The Netflix event's impressive numbers came despite the streamer experiencing several technical glitches throughout the broadcast, which analysts (and investors) mostly shrugged off.
""We view the event as a (very) successful learning experience for NFLX and expect these technical issues will not happen again with future live events,"" Pivotal Research's Wlodarczak wrote on Wednesday.
The analyst said the event's success likely means Netflix will ""accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming,"" which will help lower subscriber churn and increase the streamer's ability to raise prices.
""The NFLX service remains a highly compelling, frankly relatively inexpensive, entertainment alternative for consumers, which bodes well for future subscriber/average revenue per user growth,"" he said.

Since the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged roughly 85%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering.
Story Continues
Last week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May.
Netflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyoncé will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US.
The company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Jefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a ""breakthrough"" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth.
BofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, ""Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver.""
Netflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars.
Still, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth.
""With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients.
Valuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock ""is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025."" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025.

20241127,NFLX,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Netflix shares were on track for a fifth consecutive gain on Friday and set for their biggest weekly percentage rise since January, after the streaming media company's popular boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul.
The stock was last up 0.2% at $899.06, off its intraday record high of $908 on Thursday. It has risen every session since the Nov. 15 fight, taking the stock up more than 9% for the week.
Several brokerages this week raised their price targets on the stock, including BofA Global Research, which on Thursday bumped up its price target to $1,000 from $800.
Netflix said on Tuesday that 108 million people worldwide watched the match between Paul, a 27-year-old social media influencer-turned-prize-fighter, and the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Tyson. The event, which Paul won, was streamed live on Netflix.

Jefferies analysts, which also raised their 12-month target on Netflix to $1,000 this week, wrote in a note on Monday that the event was ""a major breakthrough for NFLX's live events strategy.""
The median 12-month price target on Netflix is $800, with 31 analysts rating the stock a ""buy"" or ""strong buy,"" 14 rating it a ""hold,"" and two analysts rating it a ""sell,"" according to LSEG data.
Kenneth Leon, vice president and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note this week: ""NFLX is flexing its streaming capability with select live sporting events that draw from a global subscriber base.""
""Advertising is still in the early stages, but is expected to be a revenue driver by 2026,"" Leon noted. CFRA also raised its price target on Netflix.
Including the session move, the stock is up roughly 85% for the year.

Daniel Roberts
Thanks Lincoln. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. Thank you for dialing in. It's an interesting time in the market, and we're pleased to have the opportunity to present both our results from the prior quarter. But also importantly, step you through how we're thinking about the short-term as well as the medium and long term.
So it's an exciting time for us, exciting time for the industry. So let's dive into it. So jumping straight through to slide 3, make sure everyone's read the disclaimer on slide 2.
So I think it's fair to say that the Bitcoin mining sector is reaching an inflection point. It's a very dynamic time in the market, and we fielded a number of questions around why miners are underperforming the price of Bitcoin over the recent months.
And what we're seeing is institutional interest returning to the space. But the question around, why isn't miners necessarily or why aren't they necessarily moving Bitcoin given it's meant to be some sort of proxy exposure, what's different this cycle. So from our perspective, we are seeing that the sector has matured. There are more ways for investors to express interest in Bitcoin. Miners that built their business around a hole strategy now have more competition than ever for that business model.
You're seeing institutional grade self-custody solutions. You're seeing the emergence of the ETFS. You're seeing companies like MicroStrategy accumulate Bitcoin through capital market products. In contrast, we're positioned as a low cost commodity producer, focused on cash on cash returns for our investors and producing Bitcoin at low cash cost. Circa $29,000 per Bitcoin as we'll see in the coming slides.
So mining business models are under scrutiny. This is an environment in which we expect a low cost, strong cash flow business to thrive. So as you can see, they're on the right hand side, business fundamentals, they're coming into focus production costs, operational, focus, capital allocation, and the outlook for growth. We believe we're well positioned for market leadership in every aspect although and ultimately, we view Bitcoin mining as Gold Mining 2.0.
Could I just ask that other speakers on the line from our side? Go on mute, please. There's a bit of background noise. Thank you. So if we could then move to slide 4. It's also an inflection point for our business, 31 exahash is weeks away.
In fact, I believe that the last miner is going to be delivered in the next seven days. Installation commissioning will take a little bit longer than that. But the 31 exahash is now weeks away making us one of the largest listed miners. Just as Bitcoin is hitting an all-time high, however, those that know us, we're not stopping there.
We are also pleased to announce that we are accelerating our expansion to 50 exahash into the first half of next year, previously it was the second half. So we've been able to bring all that forward and continuing to invest to generate more Bitcoin at an expected cash cost of $29,000 per coin.
The fundamentals of our business model have allowed us to continue to accelerate growth at low cost. Our strategy focusing on large scale projects continuing to provide a lower execution risk in a rapid platform to expand. Years of planning and procuring long lead items to mitigate supply chain risks, and finally our management capability to deliver. If we have set a target in the market, we hit it, and we will continue to do that.
This is a business model now, and this is a business in IREN, where we believe we've hit that inflection point, we've hit the economies of scale now. While we will talk more on unit economics over the coming slides at 31 exahash, we expect to be producing Bitcoin at an all in cash cost of $29,000 per coin.
With those economics and those unit economics only to improve as we scale as power costs and operating leverage really start to kick in. In relation to AI and HPC, we've got almost 2000 GPUs now operating combination of H100, H200, both NVIDIA generations. We're focused on contracting out this capacity and looking for opportunities to grow in a measured way based on robust contractual arrangements and demand that we're seeing in the market.
In respect to AI co-location and other monetization opportunities, they're also being progressed in parallel. We have high quality assets that we believe will remain valuable in a power constrained market with increasing competition from both Bitcoin mining and AI for this land and power.
We will continue not to provide guidance on specific terms or timing, given the uncertainties, given the nature that we are dealing with counterparties, it is not all within our control. However, we continue to progress negotiations with some very large counterparties and hyperscalers. We will update the market as appropriate and as we have news.
In terms of what is within our control, as we know the majority of the new generation Blackwell's from NVIDIA, those GPUs will require liquid cooling. So notwithstanding successful testing of our GPU clusters in free cooling environments, including at Childress, we will also be installing our liquid cooling infrastructure at both our Prince George and Childress data centers in the coming months to ensure we are ready to support this next generation of GPUs.
This creates opportunities for the business both across our cloud platform, as well as our co-location pathway in terms of corporate and funding initiatives. So in terms of funding, it's clear to say market conditions have improved materially over recent months, more funding options are emerging beyond the ATM.
We are focused, very focused on alternative funding instruments as part of funding our upcoming growth plans, for example, convertibles, and we'll continue to progress that over the coming months. In terms of becoming a US domestic issuer, we intend to transition to this status in 2025, reporting on a US GAAP basis.
We have also been working on potential inclusion in major US indices, for example, the Russell 2000 in the near term, given the majority of our assets are in the US. Finally, our increased scale at 31 exahash and not long after that 50 exahash combined with our non-hoddle approach i.e. we don't hold Bitcoin on our balance sheet. We mine at an expected all in cash costs of $29,000.
It's anticipated to generate very substantial operating cash flows in the near term. As such, we believe this will support potential investor distributions in 2025. We're working through specific details around what that might look like, however, we wish to again signal our commitment, and our focus on prudent capital management and generating strong cash on cash shareholder returns.
So moving along to slide 6, a little bit more about Bitcoin mining. So where we're at, we have been delivering consistent growth over the last couple of years. If we set a target, we have met it. We're now at 21 exahash above the 20 exahash previously guided and 31 exahash is just weeks away as I mentioned earlier. We're not stopping there, we are continuing 50 exahash in the first six months of next year.
So we are committed to hitting these targets. We will maintain our disciplined approach to delivery. Our focus on costs, our focus on safety. It's supported by our single site expansion at Childress where we have over 400 people on site who will continue the cadence of building out 50 megawatts of data centers every month.
No M&A is required, it's all organic growth at cost. The land in Childress cost us a few million dollars. That is it. Everything has been self-developed internally by our team. Proven people, proven delivery processes, and the strategy to focus on large scale projects continues to provide lower execution risk, more certainty and a platform that allows us to rapidly expand at low cost.
On the mining hardware side, you'll recall that we previously secured minor purchase options for S21 Pro miners at a fixed price of $18.90, these options were struck when Bitcoin was 65,000. It's taken the last six years to get our platform up to this stage.
The vision to accumulate organic development of large scale sites, building a team and know how raising capital we've now hit that inflection point, just as we are seeing, the real world really start to lag the digital world.
There is significant megawatts, significant minors, significant capital, and management expertise required from this point for the network i.e. the hashrate at a global level to scale in parallel with the Bitcoin price. Against this backdrop, there's now increasing competition for a number of those inputs, transformers, land, power with the AI traditional data center world. Now also competing for exactly the same core inputs.
To play this out with a simple thought exercise, what happens if Bitcoin moves up to 150,000? 50%? All of a sudden, you need another 7,000 megawatts of additional capacity, another $9 billion in CapEx. Transformers, long lead items, cables, networking, concrete steel, all these things that take time that are fraught with risk.
All of it to bring into the real world, real projects, real data centers, the ASIC, you cannot plug an ASIC into a high voltage transmission line, it just doesn't work. So we've set ourselves up to really become a leading force in Bitcoin mining. On slide 7 to really drill into this $29,000 cash cost per Bitcoin. We have driven it down, it is happening.
Best in class efficiency at 15 joules per terahash from 22 in the recent September quarter. Expansion at low power cost. Childress, our average power cost is a tick over $0.03 since moving the spot price with our automated curtailment algorithm a few months ago, that is becoming a larger and larger proportion of our portfolio, driving down our average power cost accordingly.
And then overheads nonpower costs, but all in cost of our business, we're really starting to see the benefits of operating leverage come through. We'll talk more to this on coming slides, but it's effectively spreading our corporate cost base across a much larger number of exahash a much larger number of expected Bitcoin mined.
So finally, in terms of operating efficiency, we believe in building high quality data centers that optimize operating conditions for our miners. It's really important to us that we maintain the highest levels of uptime and look after that fleet to maximize profitability.
Moving on to slide 8, illustrative mining economics. Some of you would have seen this on Twitter previously but one exahash of operating capacity costs are in approximately $30 million to deliver. Against a market backdrop where capital markets are valuing that at almost four times that valuation, $120 million. If you have the ability to deliver at $30 million to have something valued at $120 million, that in my simple mind, that makes a lot of sense to continue pursuing.
We see investing in additional capacity as highly accretive. It's a really simple framework for thinking about this, the unit economics to crosscheck that in terms of cash flow, $13 million of net illustrative adjusted EBITDA on a $30 million CapEx, it's around a two-year payback again, making a lot of sense.
So as we're looking all in cost to produce, you'll notice on the right hand side, a step up in renewable energy certificate costs as we continue expanding at Childress, this highlights our commitment to 100% renewable energy.
We're seeing the sustainability focus really come to the fore. There are lots of different claims out in the market around supporting renewables. At Childress, notwithstanding, 80% of the network in that area is renewable, you need the certificates. If you do not have certificates, you are not operating with renewable energy.
At the moment, a wind farm or a solar farm evacuates power into the grid, the commodity is bifurcated into two components. One is the electron that trades alongside black and brown power, the other is the certificate. If you do not buy those certificates, you are not renewable because someone else will own those certificates, and we'll be double counting it.
So this has absolutely been a critical part of our strategy, we've bought it for every electron since day one, and we will continue to do that. A key part of how we are also thinking about growth is accretion on a per share basis. How do we drive value for every shareholder in our business?
One example of how we're thinking about this is in the bottom right hand table. We've shown this analysis in terms of adjusted EBITDA per share, which highlights very strong accretion metrics as we continue to scale from 31 to 50 exahash.
We have also set out some illustrative share price levels at which equity is raised, whether that be through ordinary equity convertibles, or other alternative funding structures. We've seen a number of convertibles launched over recent months with creative strike prices, and we'll continue to look at that as all but one of our pathways to raise additional capital.
So yes, growing from $400 million to $700 million of illustrative EBITDA in the top right hand corner is super exciting but more exciting for us, is the creative nature of this growth and our continued commitment to drive cash on cash shareholder returns.
On that note, I'd like to pass over to Kent, to talk about AI and HPC.

Kent Draper
Thanks Dan. With respect to our AI Cloud Service commissioning of our recently acquired NVIDIA H200 GPUs at our Prince George data center Location is now complete. The transition from Bitcoin mining to GPUs was able to be completed in a matter of weeks. Underscoring the multipurpose nature of our data centers, and ability to rapidly scale to support customer growth ambitions.
Now that capacity is installed, we're focused on contracting out the new capacity and currently have customer trials underway. To that point, we've also been increasing our activity with respect to marketing and go to market initiatives.
As an example, in conjunction with the recent Supercompute conference in Atlanta, we hosted roundtable events in San Francisco with commercial leaders in the AI sector and have more a activity planned for the future.
Our current fleet of NVIDIA H100 H200 GPUs supports approximately $32 million of potential annualized hardware profits using less than 2.5 megawatts of data center capacity. To put that into perspective, that's less than 0.5% of our total year end data center capacity.
This is one of the elements that we particularly like about the cloud services offering. It's highly complementary to our existing operations and doesn't cannibalize our data center capacity for other use cases such as AI colocation.
Our strategy is to continue focusing on measured growth of our capacity in response to customer demand backed by good contracts and solid utilization of that capacity. In relation to colocation and other monetization opportunities, we believe that we have high quality assets which will become more and more valuable in an increasingly power constrained market, and as Dan referred to earlier, there's increasing competition for sites to support both Bitcoin mining and AI.
We expect competition for large scale grid connected power to intensify over the coming months, given some of the dynamics in the market including continued growth and adoption of AI regulatory complexities with behind the meter solutions. So for example, the recent FERC rejection of the AWS-Talen interconnect at the Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and also the timeline for new nuclear generation and other generation sources to come online.
As a result, we're seeing West Texas sites increasingly coming into focus, and there have been several hyperscaler projects announced in the region in recent months. For example, the Crusoe data center project in Abilene. With respect to our discussions underway, we continue to advance negotiations with interested parties on a range of structures for our sites, including powered land leases and built to suit contracts.
As Dan mentioned, we aren't providing guidance on terms or timing at this stage, but as we've said previously, we're actively negotiating potential transactions with hyperscalers and we'll update the market on material developments as appropriate. Monetizing our data center platform into new verticals remains a key focus for management.
We're committed to maximizing shareholder value and any transaction must reflect the strategic value of our assets. With respect to liquid cooling, our team has extensive experience designing and operating data centers optimized for power dense compute and a demonstrated execution capability. We're leveraging that experience to best position our infrastructure for opportunities in the rapidly evolving AI sector.
For instance, as many people will be aware, certain variants of the Blackwell generation of NVIDIA GPUs require liquid cooling. It's notwithstanding the success and the successful testing of our GPU clusters in our current free air cooling environment, we will be installing liquid cooling infrastructure at both our Prince George and Childress sites to ensure that we're ready to support the next generation of GPUs.
We expect this to create additional opportunities for us across both the cloud services and colocation pathways. As we touched on in the previous slide, I'm on slide 12 now, we see significant strategic value in our land and power portfolio and parties are turning their attention to power and capacity requirements for 2026 and beyond.
Today, we're excited to announce the location of our 1.4 gigawatt Sweetwater Data Center project which is immediately adjacent to the utility's high voltage substation and approximately 60 miles from the regional hub Abilene in West Texas. During the quarter, we've continued to push forward with development activities including securing an additional 800 acres of land adjacent to our existing freehold hold land, bringing our total landholding at the site to over 1,300 acres.
We've also accelerated the timeline for upgrades and energization of the utility substation from October 2026 to April 2026. Furthermore, we've commenced procurement to support the 1.4 gigawatt substation energization by April of 2026, including procurement of transformers, circuit breakers, and ancillary electrical equipment at 1,400 megawatts. This single site is larger than many entire data center markets in the US and it has the potential to be the largest Bitcoin mining facility or AI factory in the world, capable of supporting over 90 exahash of Bitcoin mining or over 800,000 GPUs.
On to slide 13. In relation to our powerful portfolio, we've spent years developing our current 2.3 gigawatts of contracted capacity. Our approach with respect to the market is only to announce sites where we have executed interconnection agreements.
This means they're not potential future megawatts, these are genuine megawatts that are contracted today through binding interconnection agreements. We've observed first hand within our own portfolio, some of the timeline, delays in securing grid approvals. And as Dan mentioned, there are a number of risks associated with development and securing capacity, which underscores the strategic value of having these megawatts contracted today, and especially at large individual sites.
Without signed interconnection agreements, the quantum of megawatts timing and cost is highly uncertain. That is why on our calls, we only highlight the 2.3 gigawatts of signed interconnections. However, we continue to develop our data center portfolio and hope to provide updates in due course on our pipeline of over 1 gigawatt of data center sites, if we're successful in signing additional interconnection agreements at those sites.
Importantly, the interconnection agreements that we have executed provide for uninterruptible power. So that means no mandatory curtailment. Any curtailment that we do is entirely voluntary in order to reduce our power costs at those sites.
Additionally, we've continued to invest internally in our development capability including growing our commercial teams at our North American headquarters. And we'll continue to look to accelerate our development activities globally and add to our organic pipeline, which means less reliance on M&A transactions to support our future growth.
Now I'll pass over to Belinda, our CFO to walk through the financial results.
Belinda Nucifora
Thank you, Kent. Good morning, to those in Sydney, and good afternoon, to those in North America. Thank you for joining us for our Q1 FY25 earnings update. As a start, I'm going to highlight our operating leverage as we scale our Childress operations.
Earlier in the presentation, Dan highlighted the illustrative mining economics on our path to 50 exahash. As shown on the slide, as we scale from today's installed capacity of 21 exahash to 50 exahash, we see potential for significant improvement in our unit economics.
The group key drivers to this being attractive power prices at Childress with the transition to spot pricing made on August 1, 2024, a reduction in the energy cost per Bitcoin mined across the portfolio due to the increased mining contribution from Childress at a lower cents per kilowatt hour price, coupled with improved fleet efficiency to the industry leading at 15 joules per terahash.
Furthermore, as we scale overheads are spread over a larger revenue base. As such overheads on a per exahash basis are expected to decrease by approximately 70% from Q1 FY25 as we scale to 50 exahash. This contributes to a significant reduction in our all in cash cost per Bitcoin of approximately $28,000 being the lowest in the industry.
As touched on earlier by Dan in the presentation, to finance this growth will be focused on alternative funding instruments. In addition, at scale, the achievement of positive operating cash flows may support a potential for investor distribution in calendar year 2025.
Moving on to the next slide. Further to the operating leverage we just discussed, this sets out the illustrative economics at various Bitcoin prices. The first column of the table shows illustrative economics at 31 exahash and 50 exahash with a Bitcoin price of $90,000 and a current network hashrate of 732 exahash.
This results in an estimated adjusted EBITDA of $435 million and $714 million respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown in the table sets out the illustrative economics associated with Bitcoin prices starting at $125,000 and scaling by 25,000 intervals to $200,000 at an implied network hashrate of 1,000 exahash.
This results in adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion at a Bitcoin price of $200,000. The estimated increase in overheads as we scale from 31 exahash to 50 exahash is approximately $23 million, primarily attributable to variable Childress site related costs, including property insurance and property county taxes.
Also mentioned earlier, we're 100% committed to renewable energy and our investment in renewable certificate costs increase as we scale from $9 million at 31 exahash to $16 million at 50 exahash. Our overheads reflect a business contributing to deliver significant growth. We have onboarded technical and go-to-market resources for our AI business and have built internal site development expertise to scale our broader portfolio.
This makes us less reliant on competitive M&A processes to scale our platform, and we see this as a strategic advantage. Moving on to the next slide, I'll touch on the quarterly results. During the quarter, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million with Bitcoin mining revenue of $54.3 million and AI cloud services revenue of $3.2 million.
The average operating hashrate for the quarter increased from 9 exahash to 12.1 exahash and we mined 821 Bitcoin at an average realized price of $66,000. Net electricity costs for the quarter increased by $4.6 million to $28.7 million. This was primarily due to the increased Childress megawatt usage as we scaled as well as the Childress energy procurement in July 2024, which was under a fixed cost, fixed quantity contract.
From August 1, 2024, Childress procurement transitioned to a spot pricing strategy. If that spot pricing strategy had been in place for the entire quarter, the cost of Bitcoin mine would have been $26,700 versus a $35,400.
As discussed in the previous slide, other costs of $21.4 million reflects a business today that is delivering significant growth and projected continued expansion over the coming years. The primary driver of the quarter on quarter increase of $0.4 million is due to Childress construction and operational insurance costs.
Now moving to our cash flows. Closing cash at bank at September 30 is reported as $98.6 million with strong receipts from Bitcoin mining activities of $49.6 million and AI cloud services of $3.7 million. The increase in electricity payments made during the quarter includes the one off liquidation payment of $7.2 million related to the transition to spot pricing strategy from August 1, 2024.
We increased our investing activities and spent a total of $387 million, which relates to expansion at Childress data center, the purchase of Bitmain S21 Pros and T21 Miners as part of the pathway to the 31 exahash and the purchase of NVIDIA H200 GPUs.
We raised $84 million of net ATM proceeds during the quarter and post that $142 million from net ATM proceeds. Cash increased to $182.4 million at October 31, 2024. We'll now turn to the balance sheet. At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of $1.3 billion, no debt and a strong balance sheet providing flexibility to fund future growth.
Total equity increased to $1.1 billion with gross proceeds of $76 million from 9.1 million shares sold under the ATM. As touched on earlier in the presentation by Dan, to finance future growth, we'll be focused on alternative funding instruments and in addition, at scale, the achievement of positive operating cash flows may support a potential for investor distribution in calendar year 2025.
I'll now turn over for Q&A.
Question and Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions)
Lucas Pipes, B. Riley Securities.
Lucas Pipes
Thank you very much, operator, and good day everyone. My first question is on Sweetwater, and how you think about the strategic process versus the organic opportunity at the site? Thank you very much for your perspective on that.
Daniel Roberts
Thanks, Lucas. Nice to see you. Look, the short answer is there's no decision point right now beyond procuring long lead items around the electrical infrastructure, so transformers, substation components, et cetera. So we're in a position to prepare dual pathways, both for Bitcoin mining as well as AI related opportunities on the colocation or otherwise.
So we're pursuing it in all parallel. And the reality is we're facing a number of different potential pathways. And the opportunity is to compare each pathway to each other as an opportunity cost. And it's everything from building out Bitcoin mining.
And if we can continue to build at $30 million and have the market value that exahash at $120 million, then that sounds pretty good. All the way through to build to suit options where we might build an AI data center for a counterparty under a build to suit model.
And again, internally deliver a component of that. There's structures like power and land, leases in there as well. So at this stage, it's working through all the options in parallel and just playing them off against each other.
Lucas Pipes
I appreciate that. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on the capital intensity on the Bitcoin mining business. Should we kind of think of that $30 million per exahash in a linear fashion up to 50? And if so, could you just remind us what the capital requirement is from where you are today to that 50 exahash ? How much capital is needed? Thank you very much for calling.
Daniel Roberts
Yes, for sure. So we haven't guided a specific number, partly because there's a number of moving parts around do we buy additional GPUs, because there's a spike in demand and the customer would like that. We're buying long lead items for Sweetwater.
But if we look in really high level terms, we previously announced that we were fully funded to the 30 exahash. Since then, we've raised about $200 million-ish under the ATM, that gives a $400 million funding requirement to go from 30 to 50.
Yes, we've had higher operating cash flows than expected because of the Bitcoin price action. But again, that's somewhat offset by other CapEx. So we haven't guided specific numbers, but in general terms, you can probably triangulate roughly what we need.
Lucas Pipes
Dan and team. I really appreciate all the color, and wish you best of luck. Thank you.
Daniel Roberts
Thank you.

Joseph Vafi
Everyone, good morning. Nice to see all the progress on so many fronts. It's great. Just kind of starting with a theoretical one, we've got a much higher Bitcoin spot price than we did, and you're now mentioning potential. It sounds like maybe a dividend or something like that next year. Just wondering at what Bitcoin level and kind of what level of exahash do you think at least the Bitcoin business can keep growing kind of more on a self-funded basis moving forward versus balance sheet related financing? And then I'll have a quick follow up.
Daniel Roberts
Yeah, sure. So we think about operating cash flows a little bit separate to investing cash flows where there are two separate decision points in our mind. So the first is operating cash profits. So how much are you generating from your operations as a going concern, and what do we do with that cash flow. The second is what is the decision around reinvestment of those cash flows.
Now, I think it's fair to say that for quite some time, 100% of all the capital we raise is going into revenue generating CapEx and using our operations to continue to support building our corporate overheads, our operating base, et cetera. And as you can see in the presentation, we're now hitting that inflection point where operating cash flows are going to be potentially substantial.
So the decision to reinvest those cash flows as distinct from distributing those cash flows to investors is something that we'll work through. But when you look at the market today and you see a number of different companies accumulating Bitcoin on their balance sheet, paying market price or close thereof to it, and we've got the opportunity to generate Bitcoin and effectively acquire Bitcoin at a cash cost of $29,000 and distribute that Bitcoin/cash out to investors who can then self-custody.
We're not that big of believers in third party custody. We've been around Bitcoin since 2013, ridden Mt. Gox, FTX, et cetera. So I think the opportunity to generate a $29,000 cash cost Bitcoin for investors and effectively distribute that coin out either through the physical coin, we'll have to look into that, or as cash flow is pretty powerful.
And I think it's important to keep that separate from investing in cash flows and how we might fund that to continue to drive that cost potentially down even lower, but drive it in aggregate.
Joseph Vafi
That's great color. And potentially exciting there in actually distributing the underlying Bitcoin instead of cash. And then just congrats on being able to announce the Sweetwater site. That's nice progress. Just, I know you started to talk about some long lead time items there. Are you going to try to get enough long lead time items for the full 1.4 gigawatts or do you think that there's a step progress there? And then any update on fiber and if you're going to have to invest on fiber interconnect for that site? Thanks a lot.
Kent Draper
Dan. I'm happy to jump in and take that one. So with respect to the full capacity there on the data center side, it will take some time to build it out. As Dan referred to earlier, we're currently at Childress able to build out about 50 megawatts a month in terms of data center capacity. So to build out a site the size of the Sweetwater data center site, it will take some period of time.
But what we're doing with the procurement of long lead items is enabling the full capacity on the high voltage substation. So this is the substation that allows you to connect into the high voltage utility grid. And then we will build out the remaining site substations and data center capacity on a progressive basis. But the long lead procurement is set up in a way to enable us to energize the entire bulk high voltage substation to the full capacity on that April 2026 timeline.
Joseph Vafi
Great. Thanks Kent. And then any update on fiber at Sweetwater. Thanks a lot guys.
Kent Draper
Yes. So in terms of fiber, there are multiple Tier 1 carriers in the area, including right up to the existing utility substation. So access to fiber is not an issue. In terms of latency, because these are Tier 1 providers, the latency to all major hyperscaler hubs is very good as well. So sub 20 milliseconds latency and sub 10 milliseconds in a number of cases. So the fiber position at that site is suitable for almost all AI applications, as well as Bitcoin mining, obviously.
Joseph Vafi
Sure. That's all positive news. Thanks for that color, Kent.

Darren Aftahi, Roth.
Darren Aftahi
Hi guys. Good morning. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I may. First, I'm just curious, strategically, can you walk through just the mindset of accelerating the 50 exahash in the context of maybe looking at opportunity costs relative to other opportunities?
And then my second question on your balance sheet, the $275 million of prepayment on the cash flow, what is that exactly related to in terms of payments? I assume it's all for the acceleration to 50 exahash. And I guess like what portion of that CapEx is already paid for? Thanks.
Daniel Roberts
I'll pass over to Belinda for the balance sheet question in a minute. But to address the first question around opportunity cost, I mean, we continue to have conversations with very large counterparties about the prospects of doing a deal at Childress.
But the reality is you've got to make a decision at some point, and the decision is right this second, the preference is to build out Bitcoin mining. The opportunity cost is comparing each pathway to another. Yes, we've received multiple offers for capacity there. But in our opinion at this stage, the prospects and the risk return proposition of building all that out at Bitcoin makes sense.
Equally, there's still some optionality there. We haven't exercised all those minor options. We've got some time to do that. So if those contractual negotiations with other parties went a slightly different direction or improved, then, I mean, we reserve the right to change our mind and pivot. But by definition, it needs to be better than the alternative which we can control, which is building out Bitcoin mining at $30 million and having the market seemingly value that at $120 million.
Belinda Nucifora
Thank you, Darren. Yeah. In relation to the prepayments, so we've got mining hardware prepayments of $122 million as well as on the GPUs $8.1 million. We also in our Childress new contract, we have to keep some collateral on Board, so we have some prepayments in relation to the electricity contract in Childress.
Darren Aftahi
Great. Appreciate all the insights. Thank you.

Reggie Smith, JPMorgan.
Reggie Smith
Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question, or good morning rather out in Australia. You had a really interesting quote in your press release, and you actually mentioned it again during the call. Some of the effect of making sure that a deal reflected the value of your assets, strategic value of the assets, I think, was the exact quote.
I'm not asking for a number, but I'm curious how you guys go about appraising the value of that, like how you think about it. We've tried to take some stabs at it, but I'm just curious how you think about that. And I have a follow up. Thank you.
Daniel Roberts
Yeah. Thanks, Reggie. To be honest, it's a bit of art and science, both hand in hand. The science element is putting the numbers down and modeling out the various pathways and scenarios. You've got Bitcoin mining and then you've got various AI colocation structures that all result essentially in an NPV valuation to the business today. So that's the science.
Notwithstanding, you've got to put assumptions into those spreadsheets, but those assumptions are informed largely by reality. When it comes to Bitcoin mining, it's CapEx, it's returns, Bitcoin price, network hash rate.
When it comes to AI transactions, it's plugging in contractual terms that are under negotiation. So it's quite easy in terms of working out at any point in time what the preference might be. Notwithstanding there's assumptions that go into that, including discount rates, cost of capital, market valuation of different types of revenue streams. So all of that goes into the bucket.
The art element is saying, well, where are we at in the market? What are the conversations we're having with market participants all the way from hyperscalers to data centers, to the banks, to real estate companies, and triangulating all that information to try and form some sort of directional view on where the market is at.
And I think it's fair to say that the market is still in transition. You've gone from the old world of effectively available capital, available data center capacity to increase the number of GPUs and meet this AI demand. All of a sudden, you seem to have hit this point in the market where hang on, we are short potentially substantial amounts of power to meet this.
I think it's absolutely fair to say there's a transition period where every counterparty is going on their own journey around how scarce is power, how real is the current demand on the AI side? And what does this mean in terms of capacity to pay an interest in transacting in a specific valuation point.
And as time goes on, what we're seeing, again, this is anecdotes, is people are now starting to realize the 1 and 0 difference between having an interconnection agreement and talking about this made up pipeline of megawatts.
I mean, we have been in development for decades, renewable energy projects through to other infrastructure to now developing power for data centers, as we've done in IREN. It is a 1 and 0 business. You could have whatever made up pipeline of megawatts you want. But unless you get to the finish line and you get that signed connection agreement, it is worth 0, absolutely nothing.
In sporting terms, the analogy is going through a home and away season, undefeated, not losing the game, being the hot price favorite, you then get to the final. You have a few injuries, the weather changes, something else goes wrong and you don't win the final or you've lost. It's a 0. The season counts for nothing and you go on to the next season. It is exactly the same in this. And I think the market is now starting to realize the value of that.
Reggie Smith
That's good. It actually leads right into my next question. It was going to be about kind of the urgency that you were sensing. And it sounds like you're starting to get that urgency. One of the things that I've noticed is that a lot of these not a lot, but several of these big tech companies have announced long range projects that deliver in 2029, 2030, haven't really seen outside of CoreWeave a deal that's like for more immediate capacity.
It sounds like there's more urgency. Maybe can you talk a little bit about how conversations have changed and whether there is more urgency on the front end, post end of kind of capacity and opportunities, how that's changing? Thanks.
Daniel Roberts
Yeah, I mean, two hours ago, we got an email from $1 trillion hyperscaler that said, they weren't interested in Sweetwater, and now they are. I mean, that's one data point. And there's lots of little anecdotes along the way. I'm kind of reluctant to go into too much detail at the risk of building expectations because at the end of the day, a lot of this is outside of our control in terms of how counterparties think about value, their capacity to transact at terms that we will deem attractive.
So it's just a matter of working through all that, knowing that we control our own destiny, being a low-cost producer of Bitcoin and generating that strong cash on cash returns with this incredible optionality that we're super excited about around a large scale AI HPC deal that might happen.
Reggie Smith
That's fair. I appreciate that. Congrats on the quarter, and good luck. Thank you.
Operator
Brett Knoblauch, Cantor Fitzgerald.
Brett Knoblauch
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Maybe just to start, I think a big news event that happened in the quarter was the FERC announcement. Have you seen like a material increase in demand post that announcement given they kind of used Texas assets much more favorably?
Daniel Roberts
Yeah, I mean, I've got not a lot to add as a follow up to answering the previous questions. I think, yes, like we are seeing more perceived demand coming through. But again, I'll use the sporting analogy. All these conversations are great, but unless you close a deal, it's one's and zeros.
And we're just not in the business of speculating and telling everyone every step of the way how good these negotiations are because unless you get a signature on a piece of paper that delivers a transaction that delivers value for shareholders, then it's worth zero.
It's the same in development. It's the same in AI deals. And we can -- you can't really control the time lines of each. You've got to continue to progress things will go wrong, things will go right, but get the signature and then you've created a proper tangible value for your shareholders.
Brett Knoblauch
Thank you. And then maybe just one more on AI cloud business. I know you guys guided for year end, it being 10% of profits. Obviously, Bitcoin has gone up a lot since then. I guess, what's the plan beyond this year for that business? And how do you view that for CapEx on GPUs relative to maybe some of the Bitcoin mining CapEx given what we've seen happening with Bitcoin over the last couple of weeks?
Daniel Roberts
Yeah, It's a great question and something we think a lot about. I think in the short term, we're probably less disposed to investing CapEx in the GPUs. And that's for two reasons. One is our current cost of capital and where we should be focusing use of funding. And I think when you look at the Bitcoin opportunity, that's very, very clear and tangible.
GPUs, they are capital intensive. We have explored debt options. Do you want to lay in the business with debt at this point in time in the absence of having a long term contract. Again, things can change quickly, so I'm going to hedge my bets here. But sitting here right here right now with our cost of capital where it is. And also, what we're seeing is a slight weakening of demand in that market.
It may be attributable to this change in generations of the NVIDIA chips. We're going from the H100, H200 generation to the Blackwells being released next year, and that will be a reasonably material step up in compute. And I think it's fair to say that we're seeing end customers be a little bit cautious around that and maybe preferring shorter term contracts on the H100 and H200s, in anticipation of those new generations come out. So we just think it's prudent to just take a measured approach.
If tonight, we get a contract, a call for a longer term contract, and it's a big opportunity, absolutely, we're going to do it. But right here right now, it feels like it's a little bit more measured, and let's just wait and see how the next few months plays out.
Brett Knoblauch
Awesome. And maybe if I could just squeeze in one more. There's been a lot of news over the past couple of weeks surrounding Bitmain, and I know you guys have a big purchase order in place. I guess, are you guys concerned that those shipments could potentially not be delivered or held off at customs or just any thoughts or comments on that?
Daniel Roberts
Yeah, I mean, for six years, we've had people throw concerns around Bitmain add ups, and I'll just continue to say exactly the same thing. We have never had anything but a fantastic experience with Bitmain. The purchase process, the post market -- the aftermarket.
In terms of supply chain hiccups, we deal with it every day. It's the consequence of dealing with a real world business and 1 million and one moving parts, but we've had no material issues. And as I mentioned on the call, I think the last of the 31 exahash in miners will be delivered in the next few, maybe seven days.
Brett Knoblauch
Awesome. All appreciate it guys. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Roberts for any closing remarks.
Daniel Roberts
Thank you, operator. Well, that rounds out our Q1 FY25 results call. We've enjoyed presenting our results, but also articulating our vision in terms of both funding side, looking at alternative structures beyond just the ATM to raise capital on potentially less dilutive terms. But importantly, the ability to invest that capital in accretive projects for our shareholders, looking at per share metrics, for example, adjusted EBITDA as outlined in our presentation and maintaining a prudent approach to capital allocation to generate those strong shareholder returns.
It's a consequence of long-term planning in this business to get it to this point, years of developing sites organically, years of planning and procurement of long lead items. And we feel that the mining sector as a whole as well as our business are at an inflection point. And over the next three to six months, we'll see that start to play out in even more tangible terms, and we're excited to position ourselves as a market leader in this area.
So thank you, everyone, for dialing in, and have a good evening.

20241127,NVDA,"Nvidia's Latest Record Quarter Show Its AI Dominance Remains Intact
Last week, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) issued its third quarter results, topping both sales and earnings estimates as well as posting a better-than-expected current quarter guidance as its end-customers, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Open AI and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL), have started receiving its next-generation AI chip, the mighty Blackwell, that is now in full production.
Third Quarter Highlights
For the quarter ended on October 27th, Nvidia reported its revenue surged 94% YoY  to $35.08 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $33.16 billion. But, this is a quarterly slowdown as sales rose 122%, 262%, and 265% during previous quarters respectively. The date center business that is at the heart of the AI hype brought in $30.8 billion with sales rising 112% YoY and surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $28.82 billion. But not all of that revenue is made of chips that power AI development as $3.1 billion of that sales figure was brought in by networking parts. Gaming business brought $3.28 billion to the revenue table. While automotive and professional visualization businesses remain much smaller, automotive sales grew 72% YoY to $449 million while the later reported 17% YoY growth, bringing in sales of $486 million.
Net income more than doubled from last year’s comparable quarter as it amounted to $19.3 billion. While net income jumped from last year’s 37 cents per share to 70 cents per share, adjusted earnings per share amounted to 81 cents, also topping LSEG’s estimate of 75 cents. Due to selling more chips, gross margin expanded to 73.5%.
Fourth Quarter Outlook
Nvidia guided for current quarter sales of about $37.5 billion plus or minus 2%. Outlook implies YoY growth of about 70%, which is a slowdown from last year’s comparable quarter when growth amounted to 265%.
Nvidia’s AI dominance remains intact.
It’s a well-known fact that Nvidia is a primary beneficiary of the ongoing AI hype, with shares nearly tripling year to date. Blackwell shipments are in for a ramp up next year, but already in the current quarter, Nvidia is in “several billion dollars” of Blackwell revenue. Demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in the next fiscal year. Now for how long can Nvidia’s AI dominance continue to soar is a different question only time is able to answer.

20241127,NVDA,"Dell Technologies (DELL, Financials) reported third-quarter earnings that were mostly in line with expectations, but guidance for the next quarter came in below analyst estimates, partly due to delays in Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell GPUs impacting AI-related revenue.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.
DELL stock is down 11.9%, changing hands for $124.83 in Wednesday's market open.
Dell projected below the analyst expectation of $2.65 adjusted profits for the fourth quarter between $2.40 to $2.60 per share. Though missing the $25.59 billion estimate, revenue for the quarter is projected to be between $24 billion and $25 billion.
Asiya Merchant, a Citi analyst, underlined a good view of Dell's future despite the less direction. Merchant observed that while the company's AI revenue dropped 6% quarter-over-quarter, the order book climbed by 11% and the pipeline expanded by 50%, presently projected at over $23 billion. Merchant kept his Buy recommendation but dropped the price target from $160 to $156.
Driven by an aging installed base in PCs and conventional servers requiring updates, Dell said it anticipated several growth drivers until fiscal 2026 including increasing artificial intelligence demand. Along with indications of PC sales revival, the mainstream server and storage industries are also healing.
Citing developing pains and slower-than-expected upgrades in PCs and storage, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reaffirmed a Buy recommendation on Dell but dropped the price objective to $150. With AI sales predicted to rise in 2025 and 2026, Rakesh also said that Dell is getting orders for AI servers among the uncertainty experienced by rivals.
Maintaining a Hold rating with a price objective of $128, TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar also expressed a cautious approach Sankar pointed out that despite delays from Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs affecting certain AI-related business, Dell's AI server capability is still strong.
While Dell is having difficulties in the PC and storage sectors, its prospects for artificial intelligence servers and larger market prospects looking beyond fiscal 2026 show promise.

During recent products and services unveiling, Fugatto, a generative AI tool that allows creating sound from text and sound prompts, was showcased by NVIDIA and adds to the company's reputation for innovativeness. According to Cramer, such actions as starting projects like Fugatto show the company is ahead of its time, which keeps the company relevant, especially in the deployment of artificial intelligence. While investors are worried about its future growth and additional competition, the company's solid fundamentals and focus on research and development make many people optimistic about its future despite the diversified stock reactions.

20241127,NVDA,"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)- the AI powerhouse of the Magnificent Seven- is down 3.18% at the time of writing. Jim Cramer sheds light on what’s happening:
Some investors say there's growing skepticism that things have peaked with Nvidia. According to Cramer, nothing is wrong. After all, we just saw the numbers, and they were great. The growing skepticism around the slowing rate of growth, increased competition, and the concern that investors are probably going to get less bang for their buck is misleading. There isn't competition from companies such as Amazon, which makes some of its chips to meet specific needs considering Nvidia doesn't have enough manufacturing capacity to meet demand.
Here is why NVDA Stock is Declining Today According to Jim Cramer
That said, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the best technology so far, so much so that it “welcomes competition”. The fact that Amazon makes some of its own chips, and remains Nvidia's ""happy"" customer, probably reinforces Nvidia's position as the go-to provider for premium, high-performance GPUs and AI chips, allowing the company to focus on its core strengths.
At the same time, many people don’t know that Nvidia also has software, Cramer says. The AI darling chip maker just unveiled a groundbreaking generative AI model named Fugatto. Fugatto is designed as a versatile tool for creating and modifying sounds using text and audio prompts. Jim Cramer states that it is an AI idea factory project and that the CEO occasionally puts out ideas like these to “get everyone thinking”.
Jensen's strategy with Fugatto seems designed to spark big-picture thinking about Nvidia's future, showcasing innovation reminiscent of what great companies used to do. While costly initiatives like this are rarer today, mega-cap companies like Nvidia continue to deliver value.
This is why Jim Cramer says:
“Don’t begrudge the mega caps—just buy them”

Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
""The fund held an underweight position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA's stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA's demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA's high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company's revenue, which presents added risk.""

20241127,NVDA,"Dell Technologies (DELL) stock sank as much as 12% early Wednesday after the company took a cautious approach to its forecast for investors while warning that AI growth ""will not be linear.""
""AI is a robust opportunity … and interest in our portfolio is [at] an all-time high with no signs of slowing down,"" Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said during a call with investors Tuesday night. ""That said, this business will not be linear, especially as customers navigate an underlying silicon road map that is changing.""
Dell's AI server revenues fell 9% in the third quarter from the prior period.
On top of a broader slump in the market for personal computers, that nonlinear growth in the AI space contributed to Dell's lower full-year outlook for its fiscal year 2025 ending in February.
The midpoint of the company’s guidance range for annual revenue fell to $96.1 billion from $97 billion since last quarter, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi noted on the earnings call. The company said it will provide a formal fiscal 2026 outlook for investors early next year.
Even with Wednesday's decline, Dell stock is still up over 65% this year.

On the call, Clarke mostly cited a slower-than-expected recovery in the PC market when asked about Dell's lower guidance, but he also pointed to customers' shifting trends toward the newest AI chips. Clarke said Dell’s consumers are looking to use Nvidia’s (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips in Dell's servers and those chips have faced some delays. Last week, Nvidia said ""production is in full steam"" for these chips.
""We saw in Q3 a shift and a pretty rapid shift of the orders moving towards our Blackwell design,"" said Clarke, noting that orders for its servers with the Blackwell design make up ""a significant portion"" of its backlog.
Traditionally a PC company, Dell's expansion into IT products in the 2010s has paid off during the AI boom.
Its servers equipped with Nvidia AI chips are used by companies including Elon Musk’s xAI and the $23 billion cloud provider CoreWeave as part of the crucial hardware used to run generative artificial intelligence software.

TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar noted that Dell's fall in AI server revenue in the most recent quarter was ""mostly due to the well-understood Blackwell pushouts.""
Sankar added that Dell's rising backlog and orders of AI servers worth an estimated $8 billion for the third quarter ""are a better representation of actual demand,"" noting Dell's AI pipeline ""now stands slightly below $20B.""

Dell CEO Michael Dell said on Nov. 17 that the company had officially shipped its first PowerEdge server using Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips.
""We were the first to ship a GB200 design [a server using Nvidia’s most advanced Blackwell configuration] in the marketplace,"" Clarke said on the call. ""Blackwell is in production. It will continue to ramp and we'll be ready.""
Overall, Dell’s third quarter results for the three months ended Nov. 1 were mixed. Its earnings of $2.15 per share were above the $2.05 expected, but its quarterly revenue of $24.4 billion fell below the anticipated $24.6 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data.

20241127,MSFT,"Investing.com -- The U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, spanning several areas of the tech giant's business including cloud computing and artificial intelligence, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell 0.6% in afterhours trading following the news.
The probe is said to be wide-ranging, covering several areas of Microsoft's businesses from cloud computing to its cyber and AI products units.
The probe comes after the antitrust watchdog spent more than a year conducting interviews with Microsoft's competitors and business partners, creating a detailed request to demand Microsoft turn over information.
FTC antitrust lawyers are expected to meet with Microsoft competitors next week to obtain more information about the company’s business practices, the sources told Bloomberg.
Microsoft and the FTC declined Bloomberg's request for comment.

20241127,MSFT,"By Jody Godoy
(Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.
Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.
Competitors have criticized Microsoft's practices they say keep customers locked into its cloud offering, Azure. The FTC fielded such complaints last year as it examined the cloud computing market.
NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft's licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.
""Given that Microsoft is the world's largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,"" the group said.
Google in September complained to the European Commission about Microsoft's practices, saying it made customers pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators, and gave them later and more limited security updates.
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.
The agency had already claimed jurisdiction over probes into Microsoft and OpenAI regarding competition in artificial intelligence, and started looking into Microsoft's $650 million deal with AI startup Inflection AI.
Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators' recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.
Alphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.
Story Continues
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google's trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.
""The Trump administration was an aggressive enforcer of the antitrust laws,"" said Andre Barlow, a lawyer with Doyle Barlow & Mazard, noting it filed suits against Google and Facebook.
""When administrations change, the agencies do not necessarily drop ongoing investigations,"" he added, noting that ""changes in administration can lead to evolving enforcement priorities and shifts in how aggressively certain types of conduct are scrutinized."" Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

20241127,MSFT,"(Bloomberg) -- The US Federal Trade Commission has opened an antitrust investigation of Microsoft Corp., drilling into everything from the company’s cloud computing and software licensing businesses to cybersecurity offerings and artificial intelligence products.

After more than a year of conducting informal interviews with competitors and business partners, antitrust enforcers have crafted a detailed request to force Microsoft to turn over information, according to people familiar with the matter. The demand, which is hundreds of pages long, has been sent to the company after FTC Chair Lina Khan signed off, said one of the people.
FTC antitrust lawyers are set to meet with Microsoft competitors next week to gather more information about the Redmond, Washington-based company’s business practices, according to two other people familiar with the plans who like the others asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.
Microsoft and the FTC declined to comment.
The FTC’s scrutiny of Microsoft’s cloud computing business gained steam after a string of cybersecurity incidents that involved the company’s products. The company is a top government contractor, providing billions of dollars in software and cloud services to US agencies including the Defense Department.
The Microsoft information demand is one of Khan’s parting shots as she steps down after helming one of the most aggressive pushes against consolidated corporate power the agency has delivered in decades. While business leaders are hoping that President-elect Donald Trump will usher in an era of lighter regulation, it will fall to his new FTC chair — still unnamed — to decide how to proceed with the case.
The FTC inquiry renews scrutiny of Microsoft for its business practices more than 25 years after the government sued the company over similar conduct involving bundling its Windows operating system and browser and unsuccessfully tried to break it up.
A key focus of the current probe is Microsoft’s bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings, according to the people familiar with the information request.
Microsoft’s cybersecurity failings, combined with its heft as a government contractor, are seen by the FTC as an example of the company’s problematic power over the market, those people said.
Story Continues
In a November 2023 report, the FTC highlighted concerns that the concentrated nature of the cloud market means that “outages, or other issues that degrade the service of a cloud provider, could have a cascading impact on the economy or specific sectors.”
The CrowdStrike crash that affected millions of devices operating on Microsoft Windows systems earlier this year was itself a testament to the widespread use of the company’s products and how it directly affects the global economy.
A portion of the probe is focused on the company’s practices related to security software called Microsoft Entra ID — formerly known as Azure Active Directory — which helps authenticate users logging in to cloud-based software, some of the people said.
Competitors have complained that Microsoft’s licensing terms and bundling of software with cloud services makes it harder for rival authentication and cybersecurity companies to compete.
Companies such as Salesforce Inc.’s Slack and Zoom Communications Inc. have said that Microsoft’s practice of giving away its Teams video-conferencing software for free in a bundle with popular software products like Word and Excel is anticompetitive and makes it harder for them to compete.

20241127,MSFT,"It’s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you’re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both.
My advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful.
Here are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you’re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch.
Video games
Video games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You’ll find deals on consoles including Sony’s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo’s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I’m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying.

Discounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve’s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services.
Headphones
Whether you’re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple’s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you’re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers.

It’s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can’t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you’re into.
You’ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it.
Laptops
In the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You’re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple’s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft’s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That’s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance.
Story Continues
Generally, when you’re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That’s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they’ll last longer than more modestly priced computers.
TVs
TVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don’t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price.
When it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you’re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set.
Televisions are displayed for sale ahead of Black Friday at a Walmart Supercenter on Nov. 14, 2023, in Burbank, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) · Mario Tama via Getty Images
If there’s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it’s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don’t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you’re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG’s C3, expect to splash out $1,300.
Phones and tablets
If you’re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you’re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you’ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy.
Tablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they’re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search.
Smart speakers and streaming devices
Amazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different.
Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku’s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google’s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I’ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up.

20241127,MSFT,"(Reuters) -Microsoft on Wednesday denied claims that it uses customer data from its Microsoft 365 applications, including Word and Excel, to train artificial intelligence models.
The response came after some users pointed out on social media that the company requires users to opt-out of its ""connected experiences"" feature, which they argued was used to train AI models.
""These claims are untrue. Microsoft does not use customer data from Microsoft 365 consumer and commercial applications to train foundational large language models,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
The spokesperson added that the ""connected experiences"" enables features such as co-authoring and cloud storage, and has no connection to how the company trains its large language models.

20241127,CRWD,"(Bloomberg) -- CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. fell in early trading on Wednesday after the cybersecurity company issued a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast, disappointing investors who have been watching for signs that it has recovered from a flawed update that crashed computers around the world.

Adjusted earnings will be 84 cents to 86 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, CrowdStrike said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts were expecting 87 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates.
Shares of CrowdStrike had fallen 5.9% at 1:33 p.m. in New York on Wednesday.
The report is the company’s second since a flawed CrowdStrike update crashed millions of devices operating on Microsoft Corp.’s Windows systems. The outage, which unfolded on July 19, disrupted a wide range of industries, including air travel, banks and health care. The company posted sales three months ago that beat expectations, a sign that investors took to mean the global IT outage wouldn’t significantly affect its finances.
Third-quarter revenue represented a bright spot in Tuesday’s report. Sales for the period came to $1.01 billion, exceeding Wall Street’s expectations. Profit, excluding some items, was 93 cents a share, compared with the average estimate of 81 cents.
CrowdStrike also raised its guidance for revenue for the full fiscal year, to $3.92 billion to $3.93 billion. Analysts were expecting $3.9 billion.
The company surpassed $4 billion in annual recurring revenue as of Oct. 31, making CrowdStrike “the fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone,” Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said in the statement.
The company excluded roughly $26 million from its annual recurring revenue in the quarter, CrowdStrike Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere said during the earnings call. That came after a distributor in the federal space provided notice of its intention “to exercise transferability rights with respect to a transaction,” and CrowdStrike concluded the transaction wouldn’t recur. That transaction remains in revenue in compliance with US revenue recognition rules, Podbere said.
CrowdStrike previously agreed to a $32 million deal with Carahsoft Technology Corp., a distributor which serves as a middleman between technology companies and government agencies, for identity protection software intended for the US Internal Revenue Service. But the IRS never purchased the software, Bloomberg reported in October.
Story Continues
The deal caused concern within CrowdStrike and, according to some legal and accounting experts, raised red flags.
Jeremy Fielding, a spokesperson for CrowdStrike, declined to say whether the company’s comments were related to the Carahsoft deal involving the IRS. “Our comments during the Q3 FY 25 earnings call speak for themselves,” he said in an email. Carahsoft didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Delta Airlines’ operations were stunted for days as a result of the outage, costing the airline at least $500 million in out-of-pocket losses, according to a lawsuit it filed against CrowdStrike in October. CrowdStrike said Delta was shifting blame “from its failure to update its antiquated IT infrastructure,” in a statement at the time.
“Following this summer’s incident as a company we were tested,” Kurtz said, in a call with investors on Tuesday. “We responded with speed, care and resolve and we focused on becoming even better.”
(Updates shares in third paragraph and with additional information in 10th and 11th paragraph. A previous version of this story corrected seventh paragraph to reflect that CrowdStrike concluded the transaction wouldn’t recur.)

20241127,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Sees Strong Module Adoption, Valuation Concerns Persist: Analysts
CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock is trading lower Wednesday after the company reported third-quarter financial results.
On Tuesday, CrowdStrike reported third-quarter revenue of $1.01 billion, up 29%, beating the consensus estimate of $982.36 million. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, beating analyst estimates of $0.81. Annual recurring revenue increased 27% to $4.02 billion.

CrowdStrike expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.029 billion—$1.035 billion, versus estimates of $1.03 billion. The company anticipates fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.84—$0.86 versus estimates of $0.86.
CrowdStrike now expects full-year revenue of $3.924 billion—$3.931 billion, compared to estimates of $3.897 billion. The company also expects full-year EPS of $3.74—$3.76, compared to estimates of $3.63.
Analysts rerated the stock after the quarterly print.
WestPark Capital analyst Paul Rodriguez reiterated CrowdStrike with a Hold.
Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained CrowdStrike with a Buy and raised the price target from $360 to $420.
WestPark Capital: Based on the upbeat quarterly print and guidance boost, Rodriguez increased their full-year estimates to $3.93 billion in revenue and $3.76 in EPS, up from prior projections of $3.89 billion and $3.62.
The adoption rate of CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity modules continues to outpace its overall revenue growth of 28.5% in the third quarter. Customers using five or more modules are driving this momentum, suggesting that spending on additional modules could sustain growth above 28% for longer than anticipated. Integrating Next-Gen SIEM and artificial intelligence tools like Charlotte AI further supports this trend, fueling customer interest and module adoption.
While the quarter’s overall performance was robust, CrowdStrike’s net new ARR declined compared to the second quarter, dropping to $217 million. The company attributed this to the July security incident and a slowdown in new customer acquisitions. Despite this, management expressed confidence in regaining growth in net new ARR as fiscal 2026 approaches.
CrowdStrike’s valuation continues to trade at a significant premium relative to its peers. The company’s calendar year 2025 price-to-sales (P/S) multiple stands at 19.7x, compared to the peer average of 10.5x. Similarly, its enterprise value-to-sales (EV/Sales) multiple of 22.4x far exceeds the peer group’s 9.3x. Analysts at WestPark reiterated a “Hold” rating, citing these valuation disparities. Rodriguez expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.034 billion and EPS of $0.85.

Needham: CrowdStrike exceeded all guided metrics in its third quarter of fiscal year 2025, demonstrating solid execution despite industry challenges. Gross retention, which declined less than 0.5% quarter-over-quarter, highlights the company’s resilience and supports management’s approach to leveraging opportunities amid crises. A $500 million quarter-over-quarter increase in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reflects a surge in multi-year contracts. CrowdStrike consolidates customers onto its Falcon platform and strengthens retention through multi-module adoption, making replacements more difficult.
Management acknowledges reduced visibility heading into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, emphasizing headwinds in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and subscription growth. However, the company remains confident about ARR reacceleration in the second half of fiscal 2026.
CrowdStrike’s Falcon Flex offering has gained significant traction, with its total contract value (TCV) nearly doubling quarter-over-quarter to $1.3 billion, up from $700 million in the prior quarter. Flex customers, often strategic partners, spend millions of dollars with CrowdStrike, far exceeding the spending of the average customer.
The company’s Next-Gen SIEM product continues to grow rapidly, with ARR increasing over 150% year-over-year, nearing $300 million. Adoption by over 2,000 customers underscores its appeal, with each paying approximately $150,000 annually.
Cikos raised the price target, applying a 21.3x EV/Sales multiple to fiscal 2026 revenue estimates. The updated valuation reflects increased confidence in CrowdStrike’s ability to execute its customer commitment strategy and outperform its target operating model. The previous price target of $360 was based on an 18.3x EV/Sales multiple.
CrowdStrike is poised for further growth as it continues to capitalize on multi-module adoption and innovative offerings like Falcon Flex and Next-Gen SIEM. Management’s focus on ARR recovery and cost optimization positions the company for improved visibility and performance exiting fiscal 2025.
Cikos expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.034 billion and EPS of $0.86. He projects fiscal 2025 revenue of $3.901 billion and EPS of $3.62.
Price Action: CRWD stock is down 6.28% at $341.42 at last check Wednesday.

20241127,CRWD,"Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) Shares Are Plunging Today
What Happened?
Shares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell 6.6% in the morning session after the company reported mixed third quarter results. The quarter itself was solid as CRWD beat across most of the key operating metrics we track, including billings, revenue, operating profit, and earnings.
However, the quarter wasn't perfect as the company provided earnings guidance for the next quarter which fell below expectations, while revenue guidance was roughly in line.
Additionally, there was an unusual update during the earnings call: the removal of $26 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) from a transaction with a distributor in the Federal vertical, which is not expected to recur.
Furthermore, management's comments during the earnings call suggest net new ARR growth is not expected to accelerate until the second half of fiscal 2026, potentially dampening near-term expectations.
Given the strong momentum leading up to the earnings report, the market may have been expecting a more convincing ""beat and raise"" quarter.
The shares closed the day at $347.71, down 4.6% from previous close.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What The Market Is Telling Us
CrowdStrike’s shares are quite volatile and have had 15 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 25.2% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit.
Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.
Lastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending earlier when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results. These results could signal a shift in sentiment given CrowdStrike's popularity within the cyber security space, especially considering its cloud security capabilities.
Story Continues
CrowdStrike is up 40.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $347.65 per share, it is still trading 11.3% below its 52-week high of $392.15 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $6,176.

""The portfolio’s largest detractor this quarter was CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), a provider of cybersecurity solutions. Its unified platform offers cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data. We trimmed the position as a risk reduction measure in mid-July due to the customer outage caused by a faulty content configuration update for the Windows sensor. The company subsequently delivered solid results that exceeded the high end of guidance across all metrics. While some new business negotiations slipped due to the outage, those are expected to wrap up in subsequent quarters. While CrowdStrike tumbled by -25%, we are encouraged to learn they have closed several large deals since the outage. Management is offering customers and prospects discounted modules and credits via its Flex program.""

OpenAI has been making headlines in the artificial intelligence realm ever since its existence, and it seems the company has something new to share almost every day. However, not all the news surrounding the company is positive. In the latest news shared by The Washington Post, OpenAI has suspended access to its latest, highly anticipated video generation tool, Sora. This suspension followed a small group of artists who had leaked access to the tool to protest the treatment they’ve been receiving at the company.
READ ALSO: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News.
Arguing that the company used them as “PR Puppets” without pay, the artists created a webpage allowing anyone to make AI videos using Sora. OpenAI granted hundreds of artists free access to the video generation tool so that they could test out the new artificial intelligence video generator. However, 20 of these artists argued that the company had taken advantage of their unpaid labor. This is what the group of artists wrote on Hugging Face, an open-source repository for artificial intelligence projects.
“Hundreds of artists provide unpaid labor through bug testing, feedback and experimental work for the program for a $150B valued company”.
The artists further added that the opportunities offered in return for helping the company, such as being selected to have their Sora-created films screened, offer “minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives. The tool was public three hours before it was shut down. OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said that the company has temporarily shut down user access to Sora while it looks into the situation.
“Hundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora’s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards. Participation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool.”
In other news, Axios reported that President-elect Donald Trump is considering naming an ""AI czar"" in the White House that will be coordinating federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence. While Elon Musk isn’t going to be the AI czar, he is expected to be involved.

20241127,CRWD,"Investing.com -- HSBC downgraded CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) to “hold” from “buy” on Thursday, citing limited near-term visibility on revenue growth, even after the cybersecurity firm reported better-than-expected quarterly results.
CrowdStrike's revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 grew 29% from a year earlier, crossing $1 billion for the first time. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by seasonal demand and incentives introduced after a July IT outage. Operating profit and earnings per share also beat forecasts, though the operating margin fell slightly compared to the previous year.
RBC Capital Markets on Tuesday noted that CrowdStrike management executed well following the July outage. The incident led to near-term challenges but ""should not impact customer lifetime value (LTV)""
However, CrowdStrike’s fourth-quarter outlook signals a slowdown, with revenue growth expected to ease to 22.1% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share forecast to drop 11%. This reflects weaker demand for extended contracts and additional products, according to HSBC.
“Given the sharp decline in the net new ARR in 3QFY25 and limited visibility of any near-term reacceleration in the trend, we now take a cautious approach given the potential for this weakness to translate in revenue deceleration,” HSBC analyst said.
HSBC raised its price target for CrowdStrike to $347 from $339, citing stronger earnings projections. However, the brokerage downgraded the stock, citing its high valuation, trading at 94 times estimated 2024 earnings, compared to a sector average of 37 times, which leaves less scope for further gains.
CrowdStrike shares have rallied significantly since August when HSBC upgraded the stock following the IT outage, but growth concerns are now dampening investor sentiment.

20241127,CRWD,"CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) just had a rollercoaster day, with shares sliding 5.5% this morning despite posting record-breaking Q3 results. The cybersecurity leader smashed expectations with adjusted earnings of $0.93 per share (versus $0.81 forecasted) and hit $1.01 billion in revenuean eye-popping 29% increase from last year. Its Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) soared past $4 billion, cementing its reputation as a heavyweight in the cybersecurity game. But here's the kicker: their Q4 guidance of $0.84$0.86 per share missed analyst estimates by a hair, spooking investors and overshadowing what should have been a victory lap.

So, what's dragging CrowdStrike down? The aftermath of its infamous July software update, which crashed countless devices and left industriesfrom airlines to banksscrambling. Delta Airlines is still fuming, suing the company for $500 million in losses. Despite the fallout, CEO George Kurtz struck a confident tone, emphasizing CrowdStrike's resilience and its plans to accelerate Net New ARR growth in 2026. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike's Falcon platform and shiny new Next-Gen SIEM offering continue to gain traction, with analysts like TD Cowen doubling down on their $380 price target. In their view, the short-term noise isn't enough to derail the company's long-term growth story.
What's the bottom line for investors? CrowdStrike's hiccup is a reality check in the fast-paced cybersecurity world, but it's far from a fatal blow. The company has set its sights on a massive $10 billion ARR milestone by 2031, and its strong Q3 numbers show it has the firepower to get there. The stock dip could be a golden opportunity for investors who can stomach some turbulence. CrowdStrike's growth machine is still hummingthis might just be the pause before the next sprint.

20241127,CRWD,"After the cybersecurity company posted a fiscal fourth-quarter earnings forecast below analysts' estimates, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) shares dropped 6% in premarket trade Wednesday, raising questions among investors about its recovery from a recent worldwide outage.
Bloomberg data indicates the company predicted adjusted earnings of $0.84 to $0.86 per share for the quarter, below the consensus estimate of $0.87.

Hello, and welcome to CrowdStrike's fiscal third-quarter 2025 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.

With that, I will now turn the call over to George.

George Kurtz
Thank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining our third-quarter FY25 earnings call. I'd like to start today's comments by sharing three key themes that excite me about this quarter and our bright future.
First, trust; the trust that customers, partners, and the market have in CrowdStrike. We grew ending ARR more than 27% year-over-year and maintained stable gross retention rates.
Second, widespread platform adoption. Our Falcon Flex subscription model is supercharging Falcon platform adoption. With CrowdStrike, cybersecurity consolidation is rapid and ROI is measurable. Falcon Flex is increasing both our share of wallet and enterprise real estate, furthering CrowdStrike as cybersecurity's AI native platform of record.
And third, trailblazing innovation. From cloud to device, data to GenAI, application to identity, and compliance to resilience, our innovation disrupts legacy markets and creates new categories. CrowdStrike is leading the future of AI-powered cybersecurity. The themes of trust, platform adoption, and innovation guide CrowdStrike's customer obsession and continued strong execution.
Following the summer's incident, as a company, we were tested. We responded with speed, care and resolve, and we focused on becoming even better, continuing to deliver industry-leading cyber protection on the Falcon platform's proven, resilient, and scaled AI native architecture. I'm encouraged by CrowdStrike's Q3 results, our first full quarter post-incident.
First, ending ARR surpassed $4 billion, making CrowdStrike the fastest pure-play cybersecurity software company to achieve this reported milestone, tracking to our $10 billion ARR vision. Second, Q3 revenue surpassed $1 billion. Subscription revenue grew 31% year over year, and total revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time in company history. Third, free cash flow of $231 million or 23% of revenue, achieving a Rule of 51 on a free cash flow basis. Fourth, we closed more than 150 Falcon Flex transactions with these customers representing more than $600 million in total deal value. And fifth, more recently, we announced and closed the acquisition of Adaptive Shield, adding SaaS posture management to our portfolio, further differentiating and connecting the Falcon platform's cloud security suite and identity protection offerings.
In addition to these achievements, I'd like to provide some perspective on what we saw in Q3. First, Falcon customers are staying with CrowdStrike as their trusted cybersecurity platform of choice. Q3 gross retention was over 97%, down less than a 0.5 percentage point. Strength in retention was driven by the value that customers receive from the Falcon platform.
Second, Falcon customers are growing with us. Q3 dollar-based net retention was 115%, temporarily impacted by the incident and reflective of customers strengthening their commitment to CrowdStrike. Customers are leveraging our customer commitment package and Flex subscription model to both increase their long-term investment in CrowdStrike and increase their adoption of the Falcon platform.
And third, we're seeing exceptional strength in key verticals and market segments. Healthcare saw a record quarter as providers are investing in cybersecurity's criticality based on heightened and targeted attacks.
Our corporate sales team covering organizations below 2,500 employees had their largest quarter ever, benefiting from Falcon Flex as well as successful competitive takeouts. These successes are in the context of CrowdStrike's sustained Fortune 500 market leadership.
Our track record of AI innovation and market-leading protection delivered on our highly resilient and cybersecurity's most performing architecture continues to resonate at scale. Our competitive win rates remain consistent to trending upwards in our total deal size for new business trended up over the last year, which we attribute to the continuous evolution of our platform solutions across cloud security, Next-Gen SIEM, identity protection, data security, and AI. Our revolutionary Falcon Flex subscription model and CrowdStrike's amplified brand recognition and favorable market sentiment from our transparent and deliberate response to the summer's incident. Through it all, we remain laser-focused on innovation, which is what drives our platform differentiation, customer stickiness, and superior protection outcomes.
This fall, we hosted the largest events in CrowdStrike's history, Fal.Con, our global flagship ecosystem event in Las Vegas, where 6,000 attendees joined us from more than 60 countries and 100 exhibiting ecosystem partners showcased their Falcon-integrated solutions. More recently, we hosted our inaugural Fal.Con Europe in Amsterdam, where we welcomed more than 1,700 attendees from more than 50 countries and showcased nearly 40 exhibiting ecosystem partners. These events demonstrate our continued global momentum, innovation, and the strength of the crowd, cybersecurity's ecosystem building with through and around CrowdStrike. Both events generated significant pipeline.
Aside from the platform innovations we announced, attendees were captivated by our novel subscription model, Falcon Flex. We announced the Falcon Flex model a year ago at Fal.Con 2023, and we shared at our Fal.Con 2024 Analyst Day that accounts that had adopted Falcon Flex represented more than $700 million in total deal value. We saw remarkable and accelerating Falcon Flex adoption in Q3, bolstered by our customer commitment packages with over 150 Falcon Flex deals in the quarter. Unpacking this momentum, we did two Falcon Flex deals every business day of the quarter on average. Accounts that have adopted the Falcon Flex model now represent more than $1.3 billion of total deal value, with the average Falcon Flex subscription being multiples larger than our typical contract value.
Flex customers enjoy preferred pricing for both their contracted modules as well as other current and future modules in our portfolio, and it all comes with the flexibility of access to the products they want when they're needed. Through Flex, platform consolidation is rapid, and ROI is real. Falcon Flex also became the key delivery mechanism for our customer commitment package. We've already worked through a significant number of CCPs, with the remainder to be concluded in the upcoming quarters.
We see Falcon Flex deal volume accelerating. Flex has ushered in a new tempo of module adoption. We've seen customers accelerate their platform demand plans across our existing as well as new products. For example, upon announcing Adaptive Shield, we had a slew of Flex customers eagerly asking if they could use their Flex dollars for Adaptive Shield SSPM adoption. Flex enables us to rapidly commercialize innovation, whether organic or acquired, across our global sales team and partner network. Flex is already proving to be a rapid platform adoption accelerator across the customer base, giving us confidence in net new ARR acceleration in the back half of next year.
Flex also broadens the customer audience for CrowdStrike as a whole. We've talked about cybersecurity moving from the back room to the boardroom. With Flex, we've expanded our customer stakeholder audience to include the CFO. The Flex subscription model aligns cybersecurity investment and more specifically, platform consolidation with measurable dollars and cents.
And with CrowdStrike Financial Services, we bring even more tangible financial value to CFOs, deepening our relationship and relevance to this increasingly important CXO persona. As we steadily engaged with more CFOs over the past year, the feedback has been resoundingly consistent. With Falcon Flex, CFOs can see the economic benefits of platform consolidation.
The Flex model solves today's customer needs while seeding future growth. Flex customers demonstrate the following Falcon platform characteristics. More Falcon platform adoption. Flex customers, on average, have adopted more than nine modules, and we expect to see these numbers continue to rise.
Faster Falcon platform adoption. All of our Flex licensing has happened in the past 12 months. In looking at this customer cohort, the amount of adoption we've seen at speed and scale is encouraging. With Flex, we have seen some customers more than double or even more than triple their module adoption.
Increased investment in CrowdStrike. Flex has allowed us to increase our share of wallet, consolidating multiple point product vendors. Looking at Q3, the average CrowdStrike customer spent hundreds of thousands while the average Flex customer spent multimillions. At the same time, Flex seamlessly takes cost out of cybersecurity programs, eliminating organizational and product inefficiencies from the long list of legacy disjointed point product cybersecurity tools.
Alongside Falcon Flex's success and larger transactions overall was the announcement of CrowdStrike Financial Services, CFS, our financing arm that aligns customer cybersecurity and cash flow objectives. CFS gives customers financial flexibility while driving larger deals, faster deal cycles, and longer subscription duration.
In our first quarter of CFS, we closed more than $49 million in deal value, including two eight-figure deals. Here are a few Flex noteworthy wins: an 8-figure expansion deal with a Fortune 500 travel leader who sought CCP pricing to do more with CrowdStrike, growing their spend with us by over $15 million. Despite impact from the summer's incident, our response and partner-assisted recovery solidified trust and inspired increased Falcon investment from the Board to executives to the cybersecurity team. Through Flex, this customer expanded their Falcon plan to include Falcon Cloud Security, bio-integrity monitoring, firewall management, and data protection going from 8 modules to 14 modules in a single Flex transaction.
An eight-figure new logo land with a Global 2000 technology manufacturer, where Falcon displaced legacy AV, a legacy SIEM, and a legacy vulnerability management product. Through Flex, the customer was able to go all in on the Falcon platform for EDR, Next-Gen SIEM, Falcon Complete MDR, Identity Protection, Threat Intelligence, and Exposure Management, consolidating four vendors in this initial Flex purchase. Consolidation goals achieved, protection outcomes delivered, and platform adoption success.
Closing off on Falcon Flex, customers are spending more, entering into longer subscription terms and taking the opportunity to achieve their consolidation objectives faster. We expect to see faster and larger ARR uplift over time through the Falcon Flex model, aligning the industry's leading cybersecurity platform with our revolutionary subscription model is a lightning in a bottle combination for current and future growth.
Next, I'd like to share our innovation progress where we're trailblazing new cybersecurity outcomes across cloud security, identity protection, and Next-Gen SIEM in addition to our data, AI, and IT investments. We're incredibly excited by the innovation taking place within both our cloud and identity businesses.
We recently announced the acquisition of Adaptive Shield, a leading vendor in the fast-growing SaaS security posture management, or SSPM market. Adaptive Shield builds on our AI leadership, giving us unmatched coverage of the rapidly growing SaaS threat plane, with more than 150 native integrations across everything from CRM tools to cloud backup to workforce productivity.
More importantly, Adaptive Shield slots in perfectly as a complement to both our cloud and identity security businesses with multiple integrations already completed, another example of CrowdStrike charting the course ahead of the market. Within Cloud Security, the combination of adaptive field with our core Falcon Cloud Security functionality gives us the broadest cloud security ecosystem coverage. This move builds on both our organic developments as well as the recent acquisition of Bionic and Flow.
With Adaptive Shield, CrowdStrike is the only platform delivering an end-to-end cloud security suite with runtime at the center of everything from code data and now SaaS to runtime. And with Adaptive Shield, we further enhanced our ability to secure the enterprise's prolific adoption of AI. CrowdStrike pioneered the use of AI for security through our on-sensor model and threat graph and pioneered the use of GenAI for improving SOC analyst workflows through Charlotte AI.
We've also recently introduced bespoke services for AI security, pen testing AI models to reduce exposure, weaknesses, and data leakage risk. At CrowdStrike, we deliver both AI for security and security for AI.
While our recently launched AI SPM offering enables organizations to secure the adoption of AI within their cloud infrastructure, Adaptive Shield works by protecting the enterprise from GenAI risk. As more employees look to leverage GenAI tools for their everyday workflows, data leakage, data theft, and adversary espionage are on the rise. The combination of AI SPM and Adaptive Shield gives our customers more holistic AI protection from code to runtime and now to the end user.
AI-powered cloud security wins in the quarter include, a unicorn AI leader that took their Falcon deployment to the next level in an eight-figure Falcon Cloud Security expansion deal. Growing their cloud security footprint rapidly over the last few years, the combination of workload protection as well as our CSPM, CIEM, and more recently, our Posture Management for AI, data, and applications solidified our position as this company's cloud security consolidator of choice. Once again, this customer set a new largest transaction record for our corporate sales team.
A [Fortune 50] retailer expanded in an eight-figure deployment of Falcon Cloud Security. Seeing the difference that runtime protection makes, we seamlessly expanded from being the company's EDR vendor of choice to its cybersecurity platform of record for the cloud and AI era.
Falcon Cloud Security goes well beyond narrow CSPM use cases and associated alert fatigue. Falcon completes CVR securing their expansive multi-cloud and hybrid cloud estate, the easy and frictionless choice.
Within identity protection, Adaptive Shield builds on our continued organic innovation. Since launching our identity prediction module, CrowdStrike has always had best-in-class coverage of active directory environments. However, with Adaptive Shield, CrowdStrike is now capable of securing identity where potentially malicious user behavior takes place. Whether on-device, in the cloud, or in a SaaS application, CrowdStrike offers holistic protection across critical identity touch points. And we're just getting started.
We recently announced support of Microsoft Entra ID, formerly Azure Active Directory, making CrowdStrike capable of securing the rapidly emerging identity threat vector for all Microsoft customers from highly regulated enterprises to born-in-the-cloud AI disruptors. Here's a representative identity win from the quarter. A Fortune 500 new logo in the travel and hospitality space saw the difference that our robust identity protection technology makes in stopping prolific actors. Replacing a patchwork of legacy technologies, we were able to showcase the differentiation of Falcon identity protection to land a sizable platform win across identity, EDR, Next-Gen SIEM, and threat intelligence.
Falcon Next-Gen SIEM has been a game changer, and we're experiencing a hypergrowth inflection point. While we provide more granular detail during our Q2 and Q4 earnings calls, Next-Gen SIEM performed exceptionally well this quarter, with net new ARR growth accelerating to over 150% year over year at multi-hundred million dollar scale.
With 30 million Fusion SOAR workflows per week and over 2,000 Next-Gen SIEM customers, Falcon Next-Gen SIEM is quickly becoming our customers' data foundation. We've introduced several new groundbreaking features. AI-generated parcels take the guesswork and learning curve out of integrating third-party data sources into Next-Gen SIEM. AI Investigator accelerates query speed and flattens analyst learning curves through a GenAI-powered query builder, and AI Alert Triage automates end-to-end workflows at the speed of AI. Yet the core differentiation for Next-Gen SIEM remains unchanged, unmatched speed and scalability and an unmatched cost with Falcon Data natively resident from the start. This is why more and more customers are ditching their legacy SIEM vendors for CrowdStrike.
Next-Gen SIEM customer wins in the quarter include an eight-figure major national health care provider that replaced a competing SIEM, expanding their Falcon usage with Next-Gen SIEM. Using CrowdStrike Financial Services, we were able to close a sizable seven-year deal.
Working across the customer C-suite, specifically with the CFO, we aligned cybersecurity innovation with cost reduction, platform consolidation with protection outcomes, and payment terms with ROI, delivering eight figures of customer business value benefits within three years of purchase. CrowdStrike is now firmly rooted as the organization's cybersecurity data platform of choice.
A near eight-figure expansion deal with a Fortune 500 manufacturing giant, where we replaced a hyperscaler SIEM in a competitive deal against several SIEM vendors. Multiple consoles and a lack of security workflows created inefficiencies for this customer. The transaction was also an opportune time to grow with CrowdStrike, purchasing Charlotte AI and Threat Intelligence as SIEM enhancements as well as other modules such as Data Protection.
Having a single console in a single platform continues to differentiate Falcon customer experiences. All the while, our innovation investments continue to grow and show promise.
Let me first talk about CrowdStrike's AI innovation and the progress we're making with Charlotte, our AI agent. Much like peer companies ServiceNow and Salesforce, we're using advanced AI models to deliver proactive and autonomous outcomes. Charlotte AI is capable of taking actions based upon observed data to achieve specific security goals.
Going well beyond the capabilities of a chatbot, Charlotte addresses a critical skills gap in human capital need by automating detection triage, traditionally a labor-intensive process for all security personnel. Charlotte AI detection triage announced that Falcon eliminates a significant amount of routine EDR investigation tasks. Charlotte continues to evolve through customer use, leveraging the Falcon platform's unique data advantage, CrowdStrike's highly curated threat data and high-fidelity security events. We had a record triple-digit growth quarter for Charlotte AI, fueled by customer demand for increased time savings and workflow automation.
Data Security with our largest Data Security quarter to date, driven by customer desire to replace legacy DLP without additional overhead. Falcon for IT. We're seeing continued demand from large enterprises seeking to unify security and IT management while eliminating vendors to further their consolidation objectives.
The Falcon platform continues to resonate at scale with partners of all types. In Q3, nearly 70% of our new subscription business was partner-sourced, illustrating the commitment and stickiness of our winning partner ecosystem. Our GSI partners are building Next-Gen SIEM practices across the world. Our hyperscaler partners are seeing CrowdStrike records, with AWS Marketplace transaction values up more than 100% year over year as organizations pursue their Falcon Flex licensing on their hyperscaler platforms of choice.
Our technology partners continue to win with us. We announced a strategic partnership with Fortinet, the global firewall market share leader by shipments. We're already seeing Fortinet take us into their accounts, and we're doing the same.
Helping us reach the long tail of SMBs, our MSSP business continues to expand at a rapid triple-digit pace through The Pax8 Marketplace, NinjaOne, and leading MSPs who contract with CrowdStrike.
And lastly, in Q3, SHI became our fourth billion-dollar partner, bringing the Falcon platform to their customers. This is highlighted by their success bringing Next-Gen SIEM, Cloud Security, Identity Protection, and Falcon Complete MDR to market. We ended Q3 with deal registrations up year over year, a marked turnaround from incident levels. Our business results speak to the conviction partners have in the Falcon platform and the multi-TAM transformation opportunity that only CrowdStrike offers.
Our continued market and technology leadership isn't only recognized by customers and partners, it is also lauded by industry analysts. Several recent noteworthy accolades include, one, the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection. Even after the summer, CrowdStrike was placed highest for ability to execute and furthest provision in the whole Magic Quadrant, ahead of all competitors in every dimension.
Two, in Gartner's critical capabilities, CrowdStrike earned the highest scores, ahead of all vendors evaluated in both core endpoint protection and managed security services for the second year in a row.
Three, Falcon Cloud Security was recognized as a frost radar leader in cloud workload protection platforms for the second consecutive year, ahead of CSPM startups and industry peers.
Four, Attack Surface Management was positioned as a leader in the Q3 2024 Forrester Wave, showcasing our emergence in a new market category with significant TAM opportunity.
And five, Falcon Next-Gen SIEM was named a major player in the latest SIEM IDC MarketScape, underscoring our success displacing the legacy SIEMs.
In closing, customers and partners remain firmly committed to CrowdStrike as their cybersecurity platform of record. Our Flex licensing model delivers accelerated platform adoption, and Falcon innovation isn't stopping. These themes set up a Q4 of continued progress in an upcoming year of back-half net new ARR acceleration growth.
Our future is bright. A vivid example that struck me this past quarter is the scale and consistency at which we're doing substantial transactions. We set a new record of million-dollar-plus transactions, closing more than 260 this quarter equating to an average of four more million-dollar-plus deals every business day. Results like these demonstrate the customer conviction, partner commitment, and market sentiment for CrowdStrike as cybersecurity's innovation leader and a security platform of record.
Before turning the call over to Burt, I would like to thank all CrowdStrikers for their dedication to our mission of stopping breaches, our partners for helping us win and continuing to build large businesses with us, and, of course, our customers for their commitment and unwavering trust in CrowdStrike.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Burt Podbere.
Burt Podbere
Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. We delivered third-quarter results above our stated expectations across all guided metrics. Our third-quarter results reflect our focused execution and relentless customer-first mindset, which drove a strong finish and quarter-over-quarter increase in pipeline despite continued headwinds and a pause in pipeline generation at the start of the quarter following July 19.
In Q3, ending ARR surpassed the $4 billion milestone, growing 27% year over year to reach $4.02 billion, of which $153 million was net new added in the quarter. As expected, the July 19 incident resulted in near-term headwinds to net new ARR as we experienced extended sales cycles with both existing and prospective customers and one-time incentives offered through our customer commitment packages, which resulted in increased contraction and muted upsell rates.
Sales cycles increased by approximately 15% year over year within enterprise accounts. As of last Friday, we closed more than half of the push deals that had remained open at the time of our Q2 call. While we normally recognize ARR contraction in the quarter a transaction is subject to renew, in Q3 FY 2025, we excluded approximately $26 million from ARR after a distributor in the federal space provided notice of its intention to exercise transferability rights with respect to a transaction, and we concluded that the transaction would not recur.
In compliance with US GAAP revenue recognition rules, this transaction remains in revenue. In total, our Q3 dollar-based gross retention rate of over 97% held resilient, with less than 0.5 percentage point decrease from Q2's strong performance. And given the July 19 incident, we are also pleased with our Q3 dollar-based net retention rate of 115% as customers embraced our customer commitment packages and more of the Falcon platform. We estimate that customer commitment packages impacted net new ARR by approximately $25 million in Q3 within our expectations.
The majority of deal value that closed in the quarter with customer commitment packages included additional product or Flex dollars rather than extended time and professional services. That, coupled with the timing and linearity of in-quarter Q3 revenue, limited the impact to Q3 revenue and contributed to the strong revenue beat in the quarter.
Our customer commitment packages are helping fuel an increase in platform and module adoption. Subscription customers with five, six, and seven or more modules grew to 66%, 47%, and 31% of subscription customers, respectively. Notably, we reached a new milestone for module adoption in the quarter as customers with eight or more modules grew to 20% of subscription customers. This momentum in increased module adoption and our Falcon Flex program gives us confidence in our customer commitment strategy and ability to reaccelerate net new ARR growth starting in the back half of fiscal year 2026.
Moving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 29% over Q3 of last year to reach $1.01 billion, ahead of our expectations and our first quarter exceeding the $1 billion milestone. Subscription revenue grew 31% over Q3 of last year to reach $962.7 million, and professional services revenue was $47.4 million. Total gross margin of 78% was flat year over year, and subscription gross margin remained strong at 80% of revenue. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $591.7 million compared to $436.1 million in the prior year.
As outlined in our last earnings call, we continue to invest in our FY 2025 plan and bolstered our R&D, quality assurance, and customer support programs. In the third quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 11% year over year to $194.9 million and operating margin was 19%. GAAP net loss attributable to CrowdStrike was $16.8 million, primarily due to $33.9 million in expenses related to the July 19 incident. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike grew 18% to $234.3 million or $0.93 on a diluted per share basis.
Cash and cash equivalents grew to $4.26 billion. Free cash flow was $230.6 million or 23% of revenue and was impacted by the July 19 incident as well as planned investments in data center and workload optimization, R&D, and sales and marketing. Additionally, the $49 million in deals financed through CrowdStrike Financial Services had a de minimis impact to Q3 free cash flow as expected.
Turning to our outlook. We are encouraged by our continued high-dollar-based gross retention rate, success of our customer commitment packages with customers opting for more product or Flex dollars, the continued strong adoption of the Falcon platform and growing module adoption rates, and quarter-over-quarter growth in pipeline. All of these positive indicators give us confidence in our ability to reaccelerate net new ARR growth starting in the back half of FY 2026.
However, in the near term, visibility remains limited, given the headwinds related to the July 19 incident that we outlined last quarter, including the delay of the vast majority of outbound pipeline generation activities for a few weeks following the July 19 incident, extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers, and continued deployment of customer commitment packages resulting in muted upsell rates and potentially higher-than-typical levels of contraction.
While in Q3, customers strongly embraced the additional modules and Flex options associated with our customer commitment packages rather than additional time, it is still too early to determine if that trend will remain the same in Q4. Recognizing our continued reduced visibility, we are maintaining our estimated impact of approximately $30 million to both net new ARR and subscription revenue in Q4 from our customer commitment packages.
As discussed last quarter, the aforementioned headwinds are additive to the expected quantified impact. While we do not typically comment on analyst estimates, we wanted to note that the vast majority of analysts are modeling Q3 to Q4 net new ARR seasonality well above historical levels. We request that you keep historical sequential seasonality in mind when updating your models.
Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, the modeling of ARR and subscription revenue should be decoupled in the short term, given the customer commitment packages. Our Fal.Con 2024 investor presentation has additional details on this dynamic.
Moving beyond the top line, we expect to incur additional GAAP tax expense in Q4 of approximately $58 million due to previous acquisitions. Additionally, we closed our acquisition of Adaptive Shield last week, which is expected to have a $0.01 to $0.02 impact to non-GAAP EPS as reflected in our Q4 guidance.
Moving to cash, we expect Q4 free cash flow to reflect a significantly more pronounced July 19 impact in comparison to Q3. This is due to collections impacted by increased flexible payment terms under customer commitment packages for deals closed in Q3, the incremental sales compensation expenses and the timing and size of G&A costs, all relating to July 19.
As a result, we do not expect to see sequential free cash flow margin leverage in Q4. We continue to expect CrowdStrike Financial Services to have a de minimis impact to free cash flow in Q4. We remain committed to achieving $10 billion in ending ARR by the end of fiscal year 2031 and achieving our target non-GAAP operating model on an annual basis by fiscal year 2029, which includes a free cash flow margin target between 34% and 38%.
Moving to our guidance. For the fourth quarter of FY 2025, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $1,028.7 million to $1,035.4 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 22%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $184.0 million to $189.0 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $210.9 million to $215.8 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.84 to $0.86, utilizing a weighted average share count of approximately 252 million shares on a diluted basis. For the full fiscal year 2025, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,923.8 million to $3,930.5 million, reflecting a growth rate of 28% to 29% over the prior fiscal year.
Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $804.4 million and $809.4 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $937.5 million and $942.6 million. Utilizing approximately 251 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.74 to $3.76.
George and I will now take your questions.
Question and Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Saket Kalia. Please unmute your line and ask your question.
Maria Riley
Saket, are you there? Operator, is he there? If not, please go to the next question. Okay, great.
Operator
Not a problem. We will move forward with the next question.
Maria Riley
No, wait. He's there.
Saket Kalia
Hey, guys. Can you hear me?
Maria Riley
Yeah. Hi, Saket. Thank you.
Saket Kalia
There we go. Sorry about that. Absolutely. So George, maybe for you, lots of helpful detail. I wanted to start, sort out just zooming out a little bit. You spend a lot of time with customers. I guess the question is, what are they telling you about some of the puts and takes to security spending next year? I mean, you've got plenty of tailwinds like lower interest rates and potentially a better macro but also different policies out of the federal government. So how do you think about those factors as you maybe gauge the health of security spending next year?
George Kurtz
Sure. Thanks, Saket. I think if you're -- and everyone probably is following some of the news, you'd see the security environment is only getting worse. E-crime groups have been prolific, and we continue to see ransomware and extortion where be very, very successful for big dollars.
So from a security environment perspective, customers want the best products, want the best platform. They want something that's going to stop the breach and be most effective, that hasn't changed. Two, they want to consolidate; this hasn't changed either. This complexity normally breeds inconsistencies and seams in protection gaps within multiple technologies, so a broad platform approach is something that aids in stopping the breach. And they want to drive down their overall operational cost, and that hasn't changed and I don't think that is going to change based upon my interactions with companies in the coming year.
So we'll see how it all unfolds, but we're certainly encouraged by the forward-looking environment based upon just what we see. And companies, whether it's the threat environment or regulatory pressures, they're going to have to spend money on the best technologies. And we're certainly going to be there to be able to capitalize on it.
Saket Kalia
Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Hamza Fodderwala, Morgan Stanley.
Hamza Fodderwala
Great. Can you hear me?
George Kurtz
Yes.
Hamza Fodderwala
Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Burt, maybe for you just to comment on the ARR or net new ARR seasonality that you spoke about for Q4. If I look at the last few years, last Q4, we had a pretty strong budget flush, pretty strong Q4 overall. The year before that, I think it was a bit more muted. When you speak on Q4 net new ARR seasonality this year, is that assuming that budget flush that we saw a year ago or something similar to what we saw maybe two years ago? Thank you.
Burt Podbere
Hi, Hamza. Thanks for your question. So when we think about Q4, I talked about some of the things that impact us and certainly, one of them is the limited visibility that we have. It's just too early to tell. We have a lot of things that are going to be in play for Q4, the continued CCP packages that we have. And with that, it just limits our visibility in terms of how we think about Q4. Generally, it is, of course, our biggest quarter, and we have the most that's subject to renewal but we still need to sell through it.
Operator
Brian Essex, JPMorgan.
Brian Essex
Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. George, great to see the durability of the growth retention rates, particularly in light of the event of July 19. Is there anything that you can call out in terms of trends that you're seeing as you're speaking with customers, both on the churn side? Like, what tend to be some of the themes of customers that are churning off?
And then also on the better adoption side, what are some of the more durable factors that are leading to better adoption rates on the platform? Thank you.
George Kurtz
Well, thank you, and good question. As you probably know, I spend a lot of my time with the larger customers and really haven't had a lot of conversations around churn. And the conversations that I have had have been recognition that we do have the best technology in the market and a recognition of how we handled the July 19 outage. And I think that's an area where we turned prices into a customer trust building opportunity. And of course, we're trying to make it right for customers.
So from my perspective, I certainly haven't seen a lot in the larger to midsized deals. In fact, our corporate business, as I called out, had the best quarter ever. So from a churn perspective, you could see some churn in the very small MSP space. It's an area where it really doesn't matter the vendor. It's easy to kind of move in and out. But I'm encouraged by the conversations that I'm having with our largest customers and a reflection on the fact that they realize that we have the best tech in the industry and the ability to stop breaches and drive down their overall operational cost from a platform perspective.
Next.
Operator
Patrick Colville, Scotiabank.
Patrick Colville
Hey, team. Thank you so much for taking my question. I guess I want to ask George. I mean, 2024 was the year of Copilots, including Charlotte AI. In your prepared remarks, George, you talked about kind of Detection Triage. I guess the topic du jour amongst the investment community is agentic AI. You didn't mention that in your prepared remarks. So I guess, how is CrowdStrike thinking about internal usage of agentic AI or possibly the ability for agentic AI to help CrowdStrike's customers? Thank you.
George Kurtz
Thanks, Patrick. And I covered that a bit in the prepared remarks and the fact that Charlotte AI was built to be something more than a Copilot. We probably built it before it even had a term, which is now agentic AI. And the whole idea with Charlotte AI was not only to collective wisdom of CrowdStrike over the last decade, all of our threat indicators, all of the sort of workflows that we've created around triaging events, and answer those questions but go beyond that to actually do work on behalf of customers. So today, and it's the way we built it, it actually will do work on behalf of customers, and that's the entire piece of SOC transformation.
And just to give you an example, we talked about Alert Triage and some of those things in the prepared remarks, but we had a customer that would take four days to create what's called a sit rep, a situational report and that manually, they would create these reports, and now takes them one hour. So that's the level of efficiency that we're seeing with Charlotte. And you couldn't do that if it was just a chatbot. It's the agentic nature of Charlotte AI, and that's what we're delivering to customers.
Internally, we're certainly leveraging a lot of what our great partners put together, whether that's Salesforce or ServiceNow or what have you. There's many technologies that we leverage, including many of the GenAI technologies to help us create greater efficiencies.
Operator
Tal Liani, Bank of America.
Tal Liani
Hello. Thank you. So Burt, I know you're cautious but your net new ARR was not bad at 150, given that we had 250 before the outage. It's -- there are some people expect it even to be negative. And I hear you now on 4Q cautious again. And the question is what are the -- how are the factors changing in 4Q? Meaning, you said that you have a big renewal quarter. Outside of the renewal or can you speak about, for example, what was your experience with renewals this past quarter? I would have thought that 4Q would be better than 3Q just because we don't have an outage in the middle, so it eliminates these 10 days or 14 days that people were kind of unclear about what's happening. So I want to understand how 4Q changes and why wouldn't 4Q be actually better than 3Q. Thanks.
Burt Podbere
Thanks, Tal. So although true that we are a little further from sun, we're still kind of fighting through the incident. But I'll give you some additional color in terms of the things that I went through when I thought about Q4. And I talked a little bit about limited visibility with Hamza. So one is when we think about what happened shortly after the incident, the lay of the vast majority of our outbound pipeline-generating activities, for the first few weeks following the incident, that certainly has an impact for Q4. So that's one.
I think we're still going to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers. I think customers have additional scrutiny, additional layers, approvals, all that sort of thing. And I think we're going to continue to deploy customer commitment packages. This is going to result in muted upsell rates and potentially higher-than-typical levels of contraction. You factor all those things together, and I still want to be mindful of those things taking place and the activities that the sales team has to do to sell through all of that.
Well, I had a couple of other things. While in Q3, customers strongly embraced the additional modules and Flex options associated with CCPs, rather than additional time, it is still too early to determine if that trend will remain the same for Q4. I want to give caution in terms of what customers are going to choose with respect to CCP. We don't know yet. We had one quarter, and so that really impacts our ability to really understand what's going to happen in the dynamics in Q4.
And then finally, I do want to talk about the fact that we are maintaining our estimated impact of approximately $30 million to both net new ARR and subscription revenue in Q4 from our customer commitment packages. And remember, the two of those, you have to decouple both of them. And we talked about that last quarter, and we talked about it in our Fal.Con 2024 investor presentation, and it has the details on that dynamic.
Operator
Joel Fishbein, Truist.
Joel Fishbein
Thanks for taking the question. I guess one for Burt. Burt, on the Falcon Flex, obviously, it sounded like it was ahead of your guys' expectations in terms of adoption. The one thing that I didn't get, what from you is the average deal term or duration of those deals, that would be really helpful. Really appreciate it.
Burt Podbere
Hey, Joel. Thanks for the catch. We didn't give a specific number but we did see deals being slightly longer, and so that excites us for sure.
Operator
Gabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Burt, I wanted to connect the dots here on what you're saying about Falcon Flex and the potential for reacceleration next year. Is there anything you're seeing in the Falcon Flex cohorts post July 19 versus this before July 19 in terms of average ARR increases, average deal sizes, et cetera, that would lead you to think that the conversion rates for the upsell routes on today's Falcon Flex deals could look different a year from now versus the baseline that you already have?
Burt Podbere
Hi, Gabriela. So I talked a little bit about the fact that we've seen deals being slightly larger, which is great. Still too early to tell what's going to happen as these renewals come due. But certainly, it goes back to how we already thought about this and how we talked about it last quarter with respect to seeding the future. And having the ability to do upsell on the renewal and getting customers to enjoy us more and wanting to use more. We had over 150 Falcon Flex deals and that's a great number.
And then, I think that we had accounts -- at the end of the day, the accounts have adopted the Falcon Flex model now represent more than $1.3 billion of total deal value, and in there with an average Falcon Flex subscription being multiples larger than our typical contract value. So those are important takeaways. Flex customers, on average, have adopted more than nine modules. So if you factor all those things together, we get encouraged again by reacceleration in the back half of next year.
Operator
Matt Hedberg, RBC.
Matt Hedberg
Thanks, guys. Can you hear me okay?
George Kurtz
Yeah.
Matt Hedberg
Yeah, great. George, a question for you. You talked about Next-Gen SIEM in the prepared remarks. It's really good to hear the growth that you're seeing there. I guess I'm wondering, what are you seeing really from a competitive perspective? I think we all are thinking that there's a good opportunity there, but just wondering about that. And then what are pushing some customers to change, I guess, is ultimately the question?
George Kurtz
Yeah. I think when you look at the Next-Gen SIEM market, and one of the things that we really, again, helped, I would say, create and pioneer, it's greater efficiencies, speed and scalability, which is just not available in legacy products. The fact that we can basically give immediate outcomes because it's all built into our system, right? This is a concept of first-party data, which comes from CrowdStrike third-party data. Well, we've created an incredible ecosystem and opened up the platform now where these workflows can be done within the Falcon platform and then aided by Charlotte AI.
So customers are putting more and more data into the technologies. And they're seeing the performance and the speed and maybe, more importantly, the cost differences between some of the legacy providers that are out there.
And we go into a POV and we go through all of the stats, and people kind of scratch their heads sometime to go, okay, prove it, and then when we get through it, they're like, we've never seen anything this fast or performant or get the outcome that we're looking for. So we're really excited about it and keep broadening the ecosystem there. And I think it represents a tremendous opportunity for us in the short, medium and long term. It's a huge business, Next-Gen SIEM and we're going to be front and center in it.
Operator
Andy Nowinski, Wells Fargo.
Andy Nowinski
Okay, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. First off, congrats on getting through what was likely your most challenging quarter you probably had in company history. So I wanted to ask a question again on Falcon Flex. I know you booked $1.3 billion in deals and you talked about how it's supercharging the adoption of your platform. But if I'm thinking about it correctly, I would think it's also supercharging your customer retention rates because as customers deploy more modules, like you said, it seems like it makes it increasingly difficult to leave the platform. So I guess, first, am I thinking about that correctly in terms of customer retention? And are you factoring in any improvement to ARR due to Falcon Flex going forward?
George Kurtz
Well, I'll take the first part, and Burt, you can feel free to chime in. It absolutely makes the platform stickier. The more modules, we know this is a fact, more modules customers use, the stickier the platform becomes. And you're talking 9, 10, we've talked about, I think, 1 to 14. That's incredibly sticky because a lot of processes are built around that. So from our perspective, it is a great opportunity for customers and for us they get a better value.
And again, what we're seeing is, in general, we're seeing customers adopt more and faster, right, which if they adopt more and faster, that gives us the opportunity to go back in and top up those Falcon Flex pool. So we are excited about the licensing mechanism. Customers are, we talked about Adaptive Shield. The day we announced that, we were at Fal.Con Europe and a customer said, okay, if I'm a Falcon Flex customer, can I use it day one when it closes? And we're like, yes, since we closed the deal and we get it skewed up, you'll be able to use it, which, again, removes a lot of friction and aids in the adoption.
So anything to add, Burt?
Burt Podbere
Yes. Just I think all the things that George said gives us more confidence in our ability to reaccelerate in the back half of next year.
Operator
Gregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.
Gregg Moskowitz
Okay, great. Thank you very much. Your RPO growth accelerated quite strongly this quarter and your RPO bookings growth, which at least by our estimates, is greater than 60%, that appears to be the highest we've seen since fiscal 2022.
Now, clearly, the customer commitment packages and Flex had a significant impact here. And so I guess with that in mind, it would just be helpful, Burt, to get your perspective on, A, how the CRPO performance was, and B, how we should generally be thinking about what these strong bookings might mean for revenue recognition and ARR when we look down the road? Thanks.
Burt Podbere
Thanks, Gregg. So I think ultimately, when we think about our view and we think about the increase, it does talk to just longer deals, longer duration. I think all the things that we've talked about, whether it's CCP, whether it's CrowdStrike Financial Services, they all add in terms of helping customers do more with us for longer periods of time, and that's reflected in our RPO number.
Operator
John DiFucci, Guggenheim.
John DiFucci
Thanks for taking my question. Burt, listen, you've always been really clear, which has, I think, been great for investors and great for the stock, too. And ARR is always and revenue have always been great, had a great connection over time. Can you -- and I know there's some small print, but I don't -- can you explain to us what's making this coupling diverge? And I don't know, hopefully, it's not a long explanation. It's probably why you haven't said it. But can you do that? Can you give us, like even if it's temporary here because I don't want to see -- my model works great for you and you're the first ones to do this. And it's really clear and you put it right out there for everybody to see. But why is that going to diverge? Why could it diverge in the short term?
Burt Podbere
So thanks, John. So number one, for all your comments. I appreciate all your comments that you made. So first, big picture, it's temporary. The divergence is temporary. And I think it just talks to when you have a CCP and out of the gate, there is, for example, extended time, it's offered, there's going to be a more immediate hit on ARR than revenue. It's going to lag. And so that's how we think about it and that's how I've tried to be clear on explaining it. Hopefully, that helps, John.
Operator
Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to George Kurtz for closing remarks.

Story Continues
Rajiv Ramaswami
Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We are happy to report first-quarter results that came in ahead of our guidance. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership, our TCO.
Taking a closer look at the first quarter, we exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $591 million. We grew our ARR 18% year over year to $1.966 billion. We also saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in new logos and solid free cash flow generation.
Our largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to organizations that are looking to modernize their IT footprint, including adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models and modern applications while also managing through disruption from industry M&A.
One of our largest wins of the quarter was a full stack expansion with a global provider of IT consulting services based in the APAC region. This existing Nutanix customer expanded with us by shifting more workloads to our cloud platform, and adding additional components of our portfolio, enabling them to increase their automation and self-service capabilities while also reducing their exposure to their other incumbent infrastructure provider. This expansion was also aimed at strengthening their go-to-market practice with Nutanix in the areas of generating AI, modern applications, and competitive migrations.
Another notable win in Q1 was a significant expansion with a North American-based Fortune 100 provider of food services and products. This customer was looking to implement a hybrid multi-cloud environment with the intent of running more of their workloads in the public cloud and lowering their total cost of ownership while also reducing their exposure to our largest competitor. They chose the Nutanix Cloud platform, including our Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2, running on AWS, along with Nutanix Cloud Management. This enables them to reduce their projected TCO by nearly 50%, while also consolidating their existing data center footprint.
On the product front, we recently announced the general availability of GPT-in-a-Box 2.0, our solution for simplifying the deployment of generative AI applications. A key component of this offering is Nutanix Enterprise AI, or NAI, which helps streamline deployment scaling and running of influencing end points for large language models. NAI can be deployed within GPT-in-a-Box on-prem or at the edge or independently, on native public cloud services, such as AWS, EKS, and Azure AKF. These new capabilities help further our vision of becoming the leading platform for running all apps and managing data anywhere.
A first-quarter new logo with the government ministry in the EMEA region demonstrated early progress with the new generative AI and modern application capabilities of our platform. This customer was looking to modernize their infrastructure and chose a full stack Nutanix solution to support development and deployment of their cloud-native and generative AI applications. They chose our GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution including our Nutanix Kubernetes Platform and Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure, as well as our Nutanix Unified storage and Nutanix Database Service offerings.
Moving on, we also continue to make progress on the partnership front, signing an expanded strategic partnership with AWS that will simplify cloud migrations and offer access to AWS services for customers looking to migrate to NC2 on AWS. As part of this collaboration, customers will gain access to promotional credits from AWS to support customer migrations and proof-of-concept trials as well as Nutanix licensing promotions. Customers can also gain access to promotional credits for migrating VMware cloud and AWS workloads to NC2 on AWS through the AWS VMware migration accelerator program.
Finally, we continue to receive industry recognition in Q1, being named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for distributed hybrid infrastructure, alongside some of the leading public cloud providers, improving from our challenged position in the 2023 Magic Quadrant.
In closing, I'm pleased with our solid first-quarter results. Our ongoing innovation on our cloud platform, particularly with respect to its support for generative AI and modern applications and on the progress we continue to make on partnerships. We remain focused while driving sustainable, profitable growth.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?
Rukmini Sivaraman
Thank you, Rajiv, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will first discuss our Q1 fiscal '25 results, followed by our guidance for Q2 fiscal '25 and an updated outlook for the full fiscal year 2025.
Results in Q1 '25 came in above the high end of our range across our guided metrics. Revenue in Q1 was $591 million, higher than the guided range of $565 million to $575 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 16%. The outperformance in revenue was driven by good renewals execution. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.966 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18%.
We saw strength in landing new customers onto our platform, helped by more leverage from our OEM and channel partners from the various programs we have put in place to incentivize new logos and from a general increase in engagement from customers looking at us as an alternative in the wake of industry M&A.
NRR, or net dollar-based retention rate at the end of Q1 was 110%. Expansion with existing customers was impacted largely by our US federal business for which Q1 is a seasonally strong quarter given their September 30 fiscal year-end. Our US Fed business performance was lower year over year relative to the strong comparison from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to impacts from the elongated continuing resolution resulting in lighter spending from our Fed customers.
Based on our current view, we expect our US federal business performance to return to more normal levels in the second quarter. In Q1, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels, which we believe is influenced by the macroeconomic environment and continued increased scrutiny on spend. In addition, as discussed during prior earnings calls, we believe the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure.
These factors also impact our ARR growth. Average contract duration in Q1 was to 3.1 years flat sequentially quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 87.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 20%, higher than our guided range of 14.5% to 15.5%, largely due to higher revenue and to a smaller extent, due to lower expenses including as a result of certain nonrecurring payments and credits.
Non-GAAP net income in Q1 was $122 million, of fully diluted EPS of $0.42 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares. GAAP net income and fully diluted GAAP EPS in Q1 were $30 million and $0.10 per share, respectively. Free cash flow in Q1 was $152 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 26%.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalence and short-term investments of $1.075 billion up from $994 million at the end of Q4.
Moving to capital allocation. We repurchased about $20 million worth of shares in Q1 and used about $79 million of cash in Q1 to retire shares related to our employees' STAC liability for their quarterly RSU vesting.
Moving to Q2 '25. Our guidance for Q2 is as follows: revenue of $635 million to $645 million; non-GAAP operating margin of 20% to 21%; fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 289 million shares.
Moving to the full year. The updated guidance for fiscal year '25 is as follows: revenue of $2.435 billion to $2.465 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 14% at third point and no change from our initial guidance. The non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 16% to 17%, an increase from our previous guidance. Free cash flow of $560 million to $610 million, representing a free cash flow margin of approximately 24% at the midpoint and an increase of $15 million relative to our prior initial guidance at the midpoint.
I will now provide some commentary and assumptions regarding our updated fiscal year '25 guidance. First, we are seeing continued land-and-expand opportunities and a growing pipeline for our solutions. However, as we have discussed previously, we expect continued uncertainty in the timing, outcome and deal structure from the growing mix of larger deals in the pipeline. And as I mentioned earlier, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels, which we believe is related to the uncertain spending environment and which we expect to continue.
Second, the guidance assumes that renewals will continue to perform well in fiscal year '25. Third, the full-year guidance assumes that average contract duration will be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '24 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings.
Fourth, the non-GAAP operating margin guidance assumes incremental prudent investments in sales and marketing and research and development, targeted towards addressing our large market opportunity. Those investments are expected to continue to ramp through the course of the fiscal year.
Finally, a note on seasonality. Based on our current view of renewal's cohorts and visibility into land and expand, we expect revenue seasonality in fiscal Q3 relative to Q2 to be similar to what we saw in fiscal year '23.
In closing, we are pleased that our Q1 performance exceeded the high end of our guidance and would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, investors and stakeholders for their continued trust in us. We remain committed to continued progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth, both through durable top line growth and expanding margins.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Question and Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Pinjalim Bora, JPMorgan.
Pinjalim Bora
Rajiv, one for you. Maybe can you talk about what are you hearing from customers around the VMS offering? Trying to understand if this new partnership with AWS. It might act as a catalyst to kind of convince people to move to NC2 or are you seeing any signs of that?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Okay. Pinjalim, Rajiv here. I think you meant VMC on AWS, correct? You said VMS --
Pinjalim Bora
Correct. VMC, correct.
Rajiv Ramaswami
VMC on AWS, correct. Okay. All right. So clearly, I think that seems to be an offering that Broadcom is not focused on as much. And it's created an opportunity for us, for sure, and customers are concerned as to what might happen with their offering.
For example, the go cloud version of their offering, garment cloud version was apparently deprecated by Broadcom. So this is one of the impetus for the expanded partnership that we have with AWS, where we are working together with them to provide EVM migration for customers from BMC onto NC2 on AWS. We talked about one of the wins last quarter actually, leading universities that actually went and did exactly that. And anyway. So this is really one of the impetus why AWS is partnering with us.
They're offering immigration credit. The migration accelerator program, and we are working together to help customers who might be interested in migrating off that offering on to something else in the public
Pinjalim Bora
Yes. Understood. One for Rukmini. Rukmini, I'm trying to understand the guidance. It seems like a very solid Q1 beat.
You took the Q2 numbers up, but the second half seems like it's an implied guide down because you didn't take the full year number up. So I'm trying to understand, is that just prudent caution around what you're seeing on the sales cycles, Were there any deals that mkind of moved from the second half into the first half that changed the seasonality a bit? And lastly, do you think we're close to a trough on NRR?
Rukmini Sivaraman
Thank you, Pinjalim. Both good questions. I'll start with your revenue guidance first. So yes, we were happy with our Q1 revenue performance, but we are only one quarter into fiscal year. And given the uncertain environment, including that related to a new administration in the US, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year top-line guide until we have a better view of how the rest of the year is going to play out.
And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we continue to see these modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. And we believe that the larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline continue to involve strategic decisions, more approvals and causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in deal structure outcome and timing.
And finally, from a seasonality perspective, we've historically seen a fairly even split in revenue between the first half and second half of the fiscal year. So our current expectations aren't that different from what we've seen historically.
So that's on the revenue top-line guidance question, Pinjalim. I think your second part of the question was around NRR. So a few things on NRR. First, I will say that given that our GRR, while we don't disclose it, we've said in the past that it has not changed significantly relative to recent levels. So given that, the largest driver of net new ARR is land and expand ACV, right?
And your question specifically is on which does not, for example, benefit from the strength that we saw in our land. So I want to first start by clarifying that. And we did see some divergence there between sort of the strength in our land performance.
Now with respect to expand, with existing customers, expand accounts for the majority of our land and expand, which was impacted largely by our US Fed business, which was lower year over year relative to the strong compare we had from Q1 a year ago, which we believe is due to the CR and the continuing resolutions in the US. And so all the dynamics you talked about in large sales cycle, larger deal sizes, various sales cycles or that does impact expand as well, Pinjalim. So that all did go into the NRR number.
Now I think your question was around, is this the -- is this -- have we hit sort of the low point for NRR. We don't guide to NRR, as you know. But we do expect that and will be impacted by some of these factors that we've talked about like the sales cycles and the mix of large deals when we expect some of that to continue.
So that, we believe is the case, but we don't explicitly guide to NRR.
Operator
Meta Marshall, Morgan Stanley.
Meta Marshall
Great. Maybe following up on the federal piece. You noted in the script that you expected kind of fiscal Q2 to be better. I would expect you would need the administration change, so maybe you wouldn't expect kind of federal to improve until fiscal Q3, but just wanted to kind of listen about what went into that commentary or you could explain that more. And then maybe just a second question.
Just any update on timing of Dell PowerFlex kind of integration? Just anything there would be helpful.
Rajiv Ramaswami
So Meta, on the federal question, I mean, we don't have visibility in terms of what the new administration is going to do or not do. So we can't really talk about what's going to happen after the new agitation comes in. So we have a near-term view on Q2, of course, which we factored in. And that's why we feel comfortable about our federal business coming back to more normal levels in Q2 based on what we know today. And of course, we'll have to see what the new administration does after they come on board.
Now on the Dell question, specifically. So as you know, Meta, there's two parts to the Dell relationship. One is the existing hyper-converged solution that we have, which will be an appliance sale by combining our software on their service. That's been in the market now this quarter, and it's still early days for that.
Your question on PowerFlex. We expect to have that in the market in the first half of calendar '25, and we expect to see some revenue contribution from it in FY26.
Operator
Jim Fish, Piper Sandler.
James Fish
I did want to build off of Meta's question and Pinjalim there a little bit. Can you just remind us how big this federal vertical can be for you guys here in fiscal Q1 versus kind of what you saw here? And what the actual impact net retention rate was? Like are we talking about a point or two difference that we would have seen versus the 110% or how to kind of quantify that?
Rukmini Sivaraman
I'll take that, Jim. So First, on quantification of Fed, we don't disclose that, Jim. But as you can imagine and we've said this before, that for our Q1 is typically the seasonally strongest quarter given it's also the federal year-end, which covers September 30. So we don't disclose that number, Jim, but that is Q1 is our strongest Fed quarter. And similarly, right, we're not going to break out NRR impact by Fed or by any other sort of segmentation at this point.
But we did see the fact that overall Fed and expand specifically was lower than last year. It was a challenge for us in Q1 relative to what we saw last Q1, which was a strong one to compare.
James Fish
Got it. And Rajiv, maybe for you. I think we're all kind of anxious to hear about when we could see more stand-alone into other storage arrays. Obviously, you just talked about the calendar first half of '25 seeing Dell PowerFlex. But how should we start thinking about Nutanix's relationships of getting stand-alone AHV integration into some of the other providers out there?
And why we wouldn't start to see that AHV attach go from 7% today to faster to 100?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Yes, I think those are two different questions there, Jim. I think on the first question, clearly, the only one that we've announced so far has been Dell PowerFlex relationship. As you can imagine, we do have plans to expand that selectively to other storage arrays over time. I'm not going to preannounce anything right now, but you can assume that we are working on that in a very careful way. At the same time, we also want to make sure that whatever we do is actually focusing on expanding the market opportunity for us and doesn't cannibalize the existing HCI opportunity.
So we are focused specifically on working with storage array vendors that are workloads that would not necessarily be easier to capture with HCI because the workload we can capture with our own HCI platform, we would like to do that at the full stack.
And over time, even for those that we do go in our goal is to sell the full stack over time. So stay tuned. I mean, we, of course, will continue to explore other options in the market when it comes to other storage arrays. And you can -- we don't have any more to say at this point. But the idea is to start with Dell and then over time expand to others.
With respect to your question on AHV penetration. Again, I think our philosophy has always been we support multiple hypervisors. And there's been a natural cadence to buy which the AHV adoption has continued to grow, and we are still at where it is. I don't necessarily need it to be 100%, frankly, but our goal is to increase the AHV footprint because we also want to be able to insert into VMware accounts, where our platform is running on top of ESX, the VMware hypervisor, and we'll continue to support that going forward as well.
But we would, of course, like to see more and more customers start to migrate over to our ASV footprint. And having, of course, this third-party storage support will only help amplify that.
Operator
Jason Ader, William Blair.
Jason Ader
So when I look at the second half and you gave basically guidance revenue per quarter for the second half. But then looking at the operating margin for the year, you raised that only slightly after having pretty significant outperformance in Q1 and also guiding to a pretty robust operating margin in Q2. So that implies the second half is going to be kind of weigh down on the operating margin.
And I know you said you're going to be ramping expenses, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing kind of idiosyncratic to the second half that we're not thinking about. And then can you talk about where that ramp up in spending is going to come. You said sales and marketing and R&D, but could you be more specific within those buckets.
Rukmini Sivaraman
Jason, first, on operating margin. So you're correct. So first, I'll start with revenue. What we said was -- I think in response to an earlier question, that our implied revenue split, first half to second half is roughly even based on the -- and that's similar to our historical patterns. While we expect operating expenses on the other hand, to grow over the course of the year, much like it did last fiscal year.
So to your point, you're correct that we will expect to see lower operating margins in the second half of the year and fiscal year '25. However, overall, we still expect to see year-over-year improvement in operating margin for the full fiscal year relative to fiscal year '24. And then to the second part of your question on where are we spending those dollars.
So first, in R&D, we have talked about investing, for example, in these AHV standalone to support the stand-alone storage arrays. So that's one area of R&D investment. Some other examples include we have ramped up our offerings around cloud native or containerized applications. That's another area generative AI plus our core enterprise platform, right, to the platform and making sure that it continues to evolve. So even within our core platforms, there are innovations that we continue to drive.
So that's on the R&D side, some examples of where we're investing.
On the sales and marketing side, we have talked about some investments we've made -- some we made last year and some will continue into this year, for example, around product specialist sellers, folks who are focused on selling our entire portfolio and helping our main field sellers go do that. We have increased some investments around the channel as another example, some inside sales folks who can be focused on driving both expansion and land around the more mid-market tiers. So those are some examples of areas that we're investing in both sales and marketing and in R&D.
Operator
Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America.
Ruplu Bhattacharya
It's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Rukmini, the renewals business has been strong. How should we think about the growth in available to renew pool in fiscal '25 versus fiscal '24? And is there any danger that renewals kind of fall off a cliff in fiscal '26? Or is there a large enough cohort of customers who are going to renew in fiscal '26 that strong growth in renewals continues and it grows as a mix of the business.
So just your thoughts on available to renew pool and how you see that business continuing to grow?
Rukmini Sivaraman
Thank you, Ruplu. So you're correct that we did talk about renewals doing well for Q1. In terms of ATR for full year fiscal year '25, I think we referred to this in our last earnings call when we gave you all the initial guide for fiscal year '25. Available to the new pool or ATR is expected to grow nicely in '25 year over year versus '24, and we'll continue to grow quite nicely over the next few years, Ruplu. So I'm not going to give you a quantification for fiscal year '26 at this point.
We're still only one quarter into '25. But yes, we expect that growth in available to renew for our renewal cohorts to continue for the next couple of years.
Ruplu Bhattacharya
Okay. And maybe for my follow-up, I'll ask you another question. Free cash flow in fiscal 1Q was very strong. It was $152 million, which I don't think, over the last three, four years, you've had such a strong 1Q. Were there any one-time items?
I know last quarter, you had said that you might get from a partner, I think you had said $30 million benefit for the full year in terms of free cash flow. So any guidance on how we should think about the progression of free cash flow first half versus second half in this year?
Rukmini Sivaraman
Thank you, Ruplu. We were happy with our free cash flow performance in Q1, as you alluded to. So nothing significant, I would call out as onetime. So you're right, those partner payments, we did call out for fiscal year '25 and those will continue to come in. They might be a little inconsistent in terms of quarter to quarter, but we're not breaking that out quarterly, Ruplu.
There wasn't any one thing I would call out. For example, in Q4, in our July quarter, we did call out there was one significant deal that we collected in that quarter. For example, there was nothing like that, that I would call out for Q1. And more generally, I think when you think about just, I think rest of the year, part of your question is $152 million was a strong Q1, and our full-year guide is $560 million to $610 million. And so I'll just remind you that, one, expenses are going up, expected to go up through the rest of the year.
So keep that in mind, right, those expenses will ramp over the course of the year, much like they did last fiscal year. So that in. And we do collect multiple years of cash from our customers typically upfront. And so that does mean that depending on duration or depending on some larger deals, there can be some variation quarter to quarter in that number, which is why we continue to guide for free cash flow really on an annual basis only.
Operator
Mike Cikos, Needham.
Michael Cikos
I'm going to ask a boring one on guidance and build on some of the line of questioning that Mr. Rader was going after on the operating margin and the operating profit. But I just wanted to get a better understanding congratulations on the 20% operating margin we're seeing here in Q1.
Is the view for full year in any way informed like are we potentially behind on hiring versus where we expected to be exiting Q1? Or are you potentially increasing your view of additional investments in sales and marketing and R&D? Because I know that's something that we had flagged on the previous quarter. Just wanted to wrestle those two items.
Rukmini Sivaraman
Thank you, Mike. Always welcome the boring question on the guide. So thank you for that. Not at all boring, actually. It's very, very practical.
So when we think of spend and our planning cycles, Mike. So we're coming out of our planning cycle. And so as we deploy this, again, similar to last fiscal year, some of this will be ramping over the course of the year. So that is in the plan. And so you'll continue to see that this year relative to last year, right?
So there's nothing unusual or different necessarily that I would call out other than, of course, as we hire people in Q1 or Q2, they might be there for partially for that quarter. But then for the next quarter, they're there for the full quarter, right? So there is that almost normalization that happened over the course of the year. And so that's what's baked into the op margin guide for the full year relative to what you saw in Q1.
Michael Cikos
Got it. And then just one other, if I could. I know that we're -- and I appreciate the commentary here as well as far as the Q2 versus 3Q seasonality on revenue. I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about this properly, even if I go back beyond last year, two years ago, we tend to see coal at a 7% to 8%, 7% feels about right as far as a sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3. And I appreciate your qualitative comments, but if you could further elaborate on that.
What is driving that seasonal component? Is it really tied to year-end in Q2 and then maybe the sales incentive comp for your sales force in Q4? Is that why we should be thinking about that Q2 to Q3 sequential movements that we're talking to?
Rukmini Sivaraman
You're exactly right, Mike. So historically, if you look at our performance, Q2 and Q4 tend to be seasonally stronger quarters from a top line perspective, exactly for the recency outline because Q2 has the December year-end. And Q4 had our end of fiscal year, and therefore, some sales incentives tied to a strong finish there. What has happened also is as we now have the renewal cohorts layering in, they tend to follow similarly the land expand performance in the past because they're just reflective of deals that were signed and when those renewals view.
So now we have the impact of historical land and expand, but the renewal cohorts are also following that pattern. So we just wanted to remind folks of that going into Q3 and give you a sense of qualitatively, what to expect relative to the Q2 guidance.
Operator
Ben Bollin, Cleveland Research Company.
Ben Bollin
Rajiv, I wanted to get your perspective a bigger picture on enterprise refresh behavior, in particular, around how you see customers evolving around three-tier versus HCI? Any thoughts on the pace and rate of enterprise on-prem AI deployments?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Yes, I'll take those two questions separately. I don't think Ben that much has changed with respect to three-tier versus HCI. We still continue to validate the proposition of 40% -- 40% to 50% lower TCO if you replace your three-tier with SCI and it also provides you the platform to really expand into becoming a hybrid cloud, which is what companies want. And so over time, I do expect to continue to see HCI gain into the legacy three-tier offering. So that part hasn't really changed.
The dynamics really haven't changed. Of course, it's usually tied to a hardware refresh cycle because that's when you refresh your storage arrays. And instead of refreshing storage here is what we tell customers when they just buy simple servers and put HCI on it. So no change really on that front.
On enterprise AI, what we see again is that the bulk of the spend so far have been not really in the enterprise, but in these large hyperscalers as they build out these massive clusters to train these large language models with huge investments from a small handful of very large providers. So we see that for sure.
Now within the enterprise, most enterprises are, I would say, in the early stages of deploying Generative AI, largely for RAG relative long into generation and fine-tuning and inferencing. They're not going to train these models. They're going to use models that are pre-existing and then use them to drive inferencing but more cost-effective, smaller clusters. We think that, that segment of the market is in early stages. We have seen the first set of applications come about.
Even this quarter, as you know, we talked about this government customer in EMEA that's starting to use our GPT 2.0 offering. I would say most enterprises are in the early stages of adoption, including ourselves, where we're targeting to see things like a 25% productivity gain for our developers, our improvements in how we manage legal contracts. So companies looking at fraud detection. These are the kind of use cases that we're starting to see emerge. But I would say it's in the early days.
Most enterprises are only now getting into the act of trying to build these applications. And I do think that this space is going to continue to grow over the next few years, but it's still largely incubation at this point in the enterprise.
Ben Bollin
That's great. And Rukmini, if I could. In the past, you had provided some perspective on the growth of $1 million-plus deals in your pipeline relative to the remainder of the business. Curious if you have any updates on that metric exiting the quarter?
Rukmini Sivaraman
Thank you, Ben. I will say we are continuing to see nice growth in our pipeline, including for the larger deals that we've talked about before, Ben, we're not updating those metrics specifically on a quarterly basis. But yes, we are seeing continued interest and engagement and growth in pipeline from those $1 million-plus sort of cohorts and more generally.

Simon Leopold, Raymond James.
Victor Chiu
This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to drill into your commentary around the increased customer engagement from VMware Basin. Maybe help us understand if this was an incremental acceleration relative to what you were previously observing? If so, maybe help us understand what's driving that and if you expect that to continue?
Rajiv Ramaswami
So, Victor, the market continues to be dynamic. But from our perspective, it's still largely unchanged in terms of our opportunity, a multiyear opportunity to gain share. So we haven't seen a significant change in that this quarter compared to the last several quarters really. And we haven't seen any real meaningful changes in our win-loss rate size around these opportunities. I'll say what we've already said before, right, a lot of these deals are tied to VMware customers, their ELA renewal cycles.
They try to when the installed base is coming up for a hardware refresh, although we are also expanding our ability to capture -- to have our solutions work on existing hardware like, for example, the three-tier work that we're doing with Dell or like continuing to be able to deploy our software on already existing BMS HCI customers. And of course, it's a dynamic market in the sense that sometimes we see aggressive behavior from Broadcom as well to keep those customers especially the very large ones. So really, I would say, net-net, nothing much has changed.
Victor Chiu
Okay. And if the organization decides that they wanted to move away from VMware kind of, on average, how long is that transition typically? And kind of what are the steps involved that required for a customer to do something like that?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Correct. It depends on the scale and complexity of their deployment. So if they are -- for example, I'll give you the two bookends. So on the small -- on the easy side, if they are just largely the say, vSphere customer and they're willing to replace their hardware. It's a very easy migration.
We can migrate that within a month or two off a relatively small scale. A lot of that is automated as well. Same goes for public cloud to public cloud. And there was a question earlier about VMS Cloud on AWS. Those offerings are actually very easy to migrate.
Again, this in a month, we can have those customers off and on to a tan offer. But at the other end of the spectrum are these large customers that use multiple VMware products with massive estates. And there, it can be many years. It can be three years to do a migration. Just because they can't migrate all of it at once, there is a requirement for a professional services engagement to convert over some of their more complex custom scripts, they have return on customer investments they've made on top of the VMS portfolio.
So those migrations tend to be complex, require professional services and take a few years. So there's an entire spectrum across those.
Victor Chiu
Do you have maybe kind of a general ballpark kind of estimation of what percentage is the easy kind of low-hanging fruit? And what --?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Yes. I would say if you look at -- with the exception of, I think, if you go to a large Tier 1 big global accounts, those are the ones that are difficult, right? The vast majority of the smaller customers are going to be more on the easy side.

I just wanted to ask, obviously, it sounds like the federal business had some headwinds. Maybe just a simple question, but Rajiv, did the enterprise business, do you think it deteriorated from a demand perspective versus last quarter? Just because it seems like good revolve, but just trying to get a kind of finer point on sort of like your thought on enterprise spending today versus maybe many days ago?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Yes. Matt, clearly, we saw the softness in Fed for sure. We saw it -- that was a very clear cut. The broader enterprise, I we've actually, again, been doing quite well at landing new logos and people migrating. But of course, some of that is perhaps due to just what's happening with the Broadcom situation.
So we haven't seen a decline in enterprise spend or less willingness to spend. What we have seen, and we've been talking about this in multiple quarters, Matt, is lot more inspection going on the Fed and a lot more approvals being required higher in the food chain, looking at TCO more carefully, which, of course, plays to our benefit in some articles what we talk about in this environment is how we can reduce TCO.
So that dynamic has been going on now for several quarters. We haven't seen much of a change. So net-net, I have to say it for the broader enterprise demand, we haven't seen a change this quarter compared to the prior quarters.
Matthew Hedberg
Got it. That's very clear. And then maybe another sort of, I guess, macro question for Rukmini. Obviously, it's not your year-end, but do you typically see a December budget flush from an enterprise percent? I can't imagine you're baking that into guidance.
Just kind of curious on historically, do you see customers kind of spend it or lose it mentality when it comes to December, your calendar year end?
Rajiv Ramaswami
I mean certainly, sometimes, right? I mean they may have a budget that's available for this year. We've seen that in the past. We probably will see some of that this year as well, right? I mean I think they do have -- I mean, if your company is on that calendar cycle, yes, you probably will have some budget to spend -- but again, I would not say we factor whatever we can see into our guide for Q2.
So nothing really different this year compared to prior years. And so typically, we see a seasonal increase in Q2 compared to Q1. And that's driven in part by the fact that what you alluded to, Matt, but people spending at the end of the year.

I just had two quick ones. Firstly, can you kind of double-click in terms of the channel incentives in place kind of what has changed versus three months ago in terms of providing the promo and the incentives to the channel, especially at the backdrop of for maybe overlapping Nutanix or VMware contract?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Yes. I mean this is a few months ago that we made the change, no recent changes, by the way, on the channel side. We made that going a while ago. But what we did, we did a couple of things there, Joe. First thing we did was we took a subset of our customer base, our target prospects and handed them off entirely to the channel to go drive.
And so we don't have our reps on those accounts. We leave it to the channel, and we provided more incentives to those channel partners to bring us business. So we have incentives in place for our channel partners to bring new logos to us in terms of rewards that they will get more rewards when they bring new logos to us. We are also committed to the channel in the sense that all our deals go through the channel partners. So we're not trying to work around them or shut them out of any of the deals.
And so we've seen, certainly, as a result of all of that, a significant increase in channel partner engagement with us over the last year or two. Some of it is, of course, just what they're seeing with Broadcom, more child partners coming to us, some of it is our own incentives that we are offering for them.
And we also have incentives for the end customer as well, right? So for example, to help them tide over migrations, we can offer them free licenses for a period of time to help them while they're still spending money on VMware to get going on our products until they're ready to go migrate fully over.
Okay. Just a follow-up, if I can. Just in terms of repatriation, just as kind of a theme, which benefits on Nutanix. Just curious if anything has changed on the repenetration, any additional data points versus last quarter?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Yes. In terms of cloud repatriation, I would say we haven't seen like a massive repatriation of workloads coming back from the public cloud. We see some of that here and there, right? That's where I would characterize it not has changed compared to past quarter. But I think what we see is, again, I can see there is people are much more careful about what they go put in the cloud.
So keep in mind that the vast majority of enterprise workloads are still on-prem, not in the public cloud. And now CIOs are being more circumspect about what to use the public cloud for. For example, there's a realization that if we have steady-state workloads, those workloads can be run more efficiently on-prem than in the public cloud. And so this CIO of therefore saying, well, I'm going to keep that workload on-prem. I'm not going to move that to the public cloud.
So that's what we are seeing.

Nehal Chokshi
Congrats on the really strong new logo up to 2% year-over-year. That's really impressive. I'm trying to put though, why is ARR decelerating given the strong land that you're seeing? And then if I look at the incremental ARR, i.e., the change quarter-over-quarter or October quarter, relative to the year ago quarter, that was down a lot as well. So thoughts on why are there such a weak incremental ARR characteristics, especially given the backdrop that you're having such strong WAN metrics?
Rukmini Sivaraman
Nehal, thank you. So a few things to -- I'll start with on your point about net new ARR. So One of the biggest drivers of net new ARR, which is simply, as you pointed out, the difference between ARR in this quarter versus the prior quarter is land and expand ACV. And given that our GRR has not changed significantly relative to recent historical levels. And so when you think about land and expand, we did see some divergence, as you point out in the performance of the land versus the expand portion of our business.
So we saw strength in the new customers. And we've talked about why that is. And so really happy with that performance.
Expansion with existing customers, which actually accounts for the majority of the land and expand was impacted largely by our US federal business, Nihal, and we've talked about why we believe that will be the case. And so -- and overall, by the way, right, we've talked about these larger opportunities in our land and expand pipeline which are taking longer to close and have data variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. So all of those factors also do impact our ARR growth. So that's how to think about just ARR and net new ARR.

Michael, Wells Fargo.
I'll ask one on behalf of Aaron. I just want to ask about GPT 2.0 or GPT-in-a-Box 2.0 solution. I'm just curious, as you think about, I guess, the positioning of that in the marketplace relative to kind of a full stack or a three-tier architecture with NVIDIA's AI enterprise software suite. How do these differ in terms of where they sit in the market that I guess do you see opportunity to maybe move up market as these solutions mature going forward?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Yes. I mean some of that is also a difference between training and inferencing. We are largely with GPT-in-a-Box focused on influencing, focusing on smaller clusters, not massive compute funds to our trade models. Smaller clusters that enterprises can use to deploy more cost-effective AI inferencing applications. I'll give you one example.
We, for example, one of our first use cases in Nutanix internally, was a customer service use case where incoming service request from a customer support ticket, the support engineer actually has a natural language into search interface through which they enter the query and then we look through all-on-one basis to try and accelerate our -- the ability to answer that issue. And that AI application is running on just a small cluster, okay, leaving an open source large language model.
And that's the kind of upstarting on GPT-in-a-Box internally. And that's the kind of use case that we're enabling for the enterprise, where you have your secure data, you want to do your inferencing on it, using existing models that are already pretrained, but fine-tuned with your use cases. So that's a cost-optimized solution.
And by the way, we are partnered with NVIDIA on that because we work with the immediate inferencing solution as well as, of course, using their GPUs to do all the hard work needed here. So again, I just think we want to distinguish between influencing on small clusters, which is mostly what we do versus training of very large clusters.
That's helpful. And if I can sneak one more in. Just as we think about an improving sort of traditional server end demand environment and as we think about refresh cycles. Obviously, that presents an insertion opportunity for you guys within three-tier architecture. So I'm curious with the new partnerships with Dell and Cisco.
Have you seen your win rates at all changing? Or do you anticipate those improving given your kind of broader ability to enter those deals?
Rajiv Ramaswami
Yes. First of all, I think I think Cisco and Dell selling our products is, of course, positive for us. And Cisco has been a good contributor to our new logos this quarter as well as last quarter. That is still, I think, very early days for us. And that's independent of the server refresh cycle or not, right?
Second, I would say, with respect to refresh cycles, yes, server refreshes will help, but also storage of freshers are important, right? Because that's when we get the opportunity to displace those three-tier architectures with HCI footprint. So both matter. I think having Dell and Cisco as friends in the market, of course, significantly helps. And at the same time, the refresh cycles -- more so, I would say storage or fresh and server refresh will help us insert HCI into existing deployments.

""The portfolio's holding in semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies Broadcom and Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ:SMTC) contributed to performance relative to the fund's benchmark. Broadcom sells custom AI Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to Google, Meta and one other undisclosed Cloud Service Provider (CSP), while Semtech is a supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors used for Internet of Things (IoT) systems and cloud connectivity. Broadcom and Semtech were two overweight positions for the portfolio compared to the benchmark and both companies’ stock price moved higher during the third quarter. Semtech recently entered into a definite agreement with Traxmate, a leading global IoT tracking platform provider. The partnership and incorporation of Traxmate's precise location and tracking services should seemingly integrate with Semtech's low-power, location-aware LoRa Edge platform to deliver efficient tracking solutions. Broadcom has been a long-term holding in the fund and remains one of our team's highest-conviction ideas. The company expects to ship the same amount of AI computing units as NVIDIA this year and should continue to benefit from a focus in the U.S. to produce more chips domestically due to heightened geopolitical risk around Taiwan.""

20241127,AVGO,"We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.
On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies.
Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally.
First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms.
Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.
Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services.
Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

Oaktree Capital’s Howard Marks on Investing Amid Chaos
In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil.
Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.
Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.
On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.
The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

20241127,AVGO,"While Nvidia (NVDA) continues dominating the AI chip market, investors seek additional opportunities in the rapidly evolving sector. Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations.
Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry.
Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options.
Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: ""It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software — and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.""

Chicago, IL – November 22, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of Stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Merck & Co., Inc. MRK, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM and Natural Health Trends Corp. NHTC.
Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:
Top Analyst Reports for Broadcom, Merck and Qualcomm
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, Natural Health Trends Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Broadcom’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the last two years (+208.0% vs. +157.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for the company’s networking products are suitable for addressing the needs of an increasing AI workload and the growing need for fast networking in data centers. The acquisition of VMware has also been a plus.
However, a highly competitive market and a relatively low customer base have remained causes for concern. Also, Broadcom’s frequent acquisitions, like that of VMWare, have escalated integration risks.
(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)
Merck’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past two years (-8.8% vs. +15.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs for the company. Also, there are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.
Yet, with continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products have also been core growth drivers.
(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)
Shares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +43.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, a shift in the shares among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from its Snapdragon platform.
Story Continues
Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High operating expenses and R&D costs have remained a headwind. Qualcomm is also expected to face softness in demand from China.
However, with the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in the mobile space. The company formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions.
(You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)
Shares of Natural Health Trends have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+1.8% vs. +21.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, a declining active member base remains the biggest concern for the company. It faces liquidity challenges and high operating expenses. Dependency on key markets and intense competition pose additional risks.
However, expansion into new markets and improvement in cost management bode well.

20241127,AVGO,"Investor confidence in certain major companies has propelled markets higher, but there are also those betting against big-name stocks through short selling amid continued uncertainty.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly topped the 6,000-point mark in the recent rally following Donald Trump's election win, though they have since eased back, with the main US index closing Wednesday's session flat at 5,917.
While markets broadly rose following the US election, there were a particular group of stocks that rallied in what has been dubbed the ""Trump trade"", around expectations as to the policies that the Republican president-elect could look to implement after he returns to the White House in January.
One of which was Tesla (TSLA), as the electric carmaker's CEO Elon Musk was a major supporter of Trump's campaign and has since been nominated by the president-elect to co-lead the recently announced Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The post-election rally in Tesla stock pushed its market valuation to over the $1tn mark, which was welcome news for investors that are bullish about the company's prospects.
However, not all investors were reaping the benefits, as data from S3 Partners showed that short-sellers had lost nearly $8bn by the Monday after the election, according to Business Insider.
Unlike the traditional way of investing in markets by buying shares with the goal of selling them at a higher price, also known as going ""long"", short selling aims to make a profit on the declining price of the stock. An investor does this by borrowing stock from a broker and then selling them.
The hope is that the share price will then fall so that the investor can by them back at a lower price and return them back to the broker, profiting from the difference.
And while long investors appear to be confident in their market winners, data indicates that short sellers also have strong conviction in their bets against major companies.
Analysis from S3 Partners' research team, released on Friday, showed that S&P 500 short flows grew by $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in the last month.
Here are the major companies that have become popular shorts.
Popular short stocks
S3 Partners' analysis showed that the largest sector position for S&P 500 stocks was in information technology. The research showed that $4.2bn new shorts in this sector were opened over the last month, while $3.6bn shorts were closed, which worked out to a $582m net increase.
Story continues
Chipmaking conglomerate Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for $1.8bn of new shorts, while fellow chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) was responsible for $1.05bn of these positions.
The demand for chips as a key component in enabling the AI boom has driven these shares higher, with Nvidia recently overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company, at a market valuation of $3.6tn.
At the same time, there have been questions as to whether these companies can maintain the same rate of growth.
Shares in Broadcom fell in September after the guided to revenues of $14bn in the fourth quarter, which was below the $14.3bn Wall Street was expecting.
And Nvidia's highly anticipated third-quarter results release on Wednesday appeared to disappoint investors, in terms of its revenue guidance and a decline in gross margins. In fact, despite its consistent outperformance on key metrics, Nvidia has experienced gradual decline growth margins quarter-on-quarter.

The discretionary sector logged a $528m increase in net short positions, led by Tesla at $660m.
Tesla shares were on the rise prior to the post-election rally, with the stock surging on the back of third quarter beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins.
However, revenue was lower than market estimates and Tesla said it only expected vehicle deliveries to achieve ""slight growth"" in 2024. And Tesla's robotaxi event earlier in October left investors wanting more details on the company's new product offerings and timeframes.
S3 Partners' analysis also showed that there was a $513m increase in net short positions in the industrials sector, which included positions of $200m in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER).
Following its recent results, Uber's shares slid after its all-important gross bookings figure, which tracks total revenue before fees and deductions such as driver pay, came in below estimates.
S&P healthcare stocks saw nearly $500m in new short positions but just $75m in closings. New positions were spread equally across CVS Health Corp (CVS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), though S3 Partners' research team said this ""may be related to the [US] election"".
They said that despite this significant activity in ""all sectors saw negative returns for shorts, led by tech and discretionary losses"".
Global short bets
Meanwhile, French luxury company LVMH (MC.PA) was found to be one of the most crowded short position in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, according to a monthly report by Hazeltree.
The data and tech firm's October report, released last week, lists the top shorted stocks across regions based on different factors. This includes a score on ""crowdedness"", on a scale of one to 99, which represents percentage of the institutional investors’ supply of a particular stock that is being lent out.
LVMH, which is the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, had a crowdedness score of 99 in October.
The company's shares slumped after it recently reported a dip in sales for the first nine months of the year, amid an ""uncertain economic and geopolitical environment"" and the stock is down 22% year-to-date.

The luxury sector has been struggling as consumers have been reining in spending, with brands particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.
Kering (KER.PA), whose umbrella of brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, was another French luxury company that Hazeltree found to be among the most popular shorts in EMEA.
Shares are down 48% so far this year, with the company having also reported a drop in revenues in its most recent results, as well as warning of lower operating income for the year.
Multinational drinks company Diageo (DGE.L) was another name on Hazeltree's list, with a crowdedness score of 74.
Diageo, which is listed on the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), reported a slight decline in overall organic net sales in its 2024 preliminary results at the end of July, with the biggest decline recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.
It has been flagged as a company that could potentially be negatively impacted by president-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs.
In South Asia, one of the most notable shorts of recent years has been Hindenberg Research's position in India's Adani Group companies.

Hindenberg revealed its short position, through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments, in January last year. It alleged the conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group responded with 413-page report, saying that Hindenberg's claims were ""nothing but a lie"".
On Wednesday, US prosecutors charged Adani Group's billionaire owner Gautam Adani over an alleged $250m bribery scheme.
Shares in Adani Group companies tumbled, including its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS), which fell nearly 23%.
In a statement, Adani Group said that the allegations were ""baseless"".
Hindenberg's focus is on investigative research into companies, so it's a more activist approach to short selling.
However, as the wider data shows, even as many investors pile into the market winners, there are also those that are confident in betting against the big sector leaders to generate better returns.

20241127,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.
With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.
Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.
Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that ""it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions."" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to ""prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.""
To prove that ""equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,"" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that ""market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House."" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.
Story Continues
The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.
Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank ""urges caution"" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.
Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'
Between then and now, the bank believes that ""generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage."" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms ""building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.""
While generative AI might be in the ""trough of disillusionment,"" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the ""overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032"" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.
Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.
However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.
According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is ""more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud."" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.
Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.
Our Methodology
To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that enables businesses to automate their functions and manage human resources. Since it's a SaaS company, the firm's narrative is driven by its ability to land large deals and generate stable subscription revenue. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s shares are up 46% year to date, and before October start, the stock had gained 26%. The pre-October modest performance is driven by sluggish non-AI IT spending due to high rates constraining budgets. However, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has started to play on the front foot for AI, as it plans to start providing AI agents to businesses to automate their operations and reduce costs. The shares have gained 10.8% since the firm's third-quarter earnings which saw its fourth-quarter subscription revenue guidance of $2.875 billion - $2.880 billion beat analyst estimates of $2.85 billion. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s ability to deliver and surpass these estimates coupled with a penetration of the AI assistant market could create additional tailwinds.
Polen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“In the third quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were NVIDIA (not owned), Shopify, and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and bookings during the quarter, with subscription sales up +23%. Encouragingly, GenAI offerings within its product suite, rolled out in late 2023, already appear to be an incremental driver of this growth. In our view, ServiceNow is a great example of a consistent grower, with a strong moat serving diverse and growing end markets with expanding margin opportunities over time.”
Overall NOW ranks 5th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20241127,NOW,"Three Reasons Investors Love ServiceNow (NOW)
What a fantastic six months it’s been for ServiceNow. Shares of the company have skyrocketed 44.9%, hitting $1,055. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.
Is now still a good time to buy NOW? Or are investors being too optimistic? Find out in our full research report, it’s free.
Why Is NOW a Good Business?
Founded by Fred Luddy, who coded the company's initial prototype on a flight from San Francisco to London, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software provider helping companies automate workflows across IT, HR, and customer service.
1. ARR Surges as Recurring Revenue Flows In
While reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.
ServiceNow’s ARR punched in at $10.86 billion in Q3, and over the last four quarters, its year-on-year growth averaged 24.2%. This performance was impressive and shows that customers are willing to take multi-year bets on the company’s technology. Its growth also makes ServiceNow a more predictable business, a tailwind for its valuation as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue.
ServiceNow Annual Recurring Revenue
2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable
Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses scale.
Sell-side analysts expect ServiceNow’s revenue to grow 19.8% over the next 12 months. We think its growth trajectory is attractive and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.
3. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains
One of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company’s products and services over time.
ServiceNow’s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 125% in Q3. This means ServiceNow would’ve grown its revenue by 25% even if it didn’t win any new customers over the last 12 months.
ServiceNow Net Revenue Retention Rate
ServiceNow has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.

Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years.
“Just to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we’ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get—very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they’ve trained haven’t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, “There is no wall,” so maybe it’s not an issue—we’ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.”
However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market.
“I think if you take a longer-term view—2 to 4 years—we’re still very confident we’ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn’t mean there won’t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we’ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.”

As the “AI arms race” continues to evolve, countries are increasingly beginning to realize the efforts they need to expend to stay relevant. One such country in the picture that’s stepping up its efforts is Britain. On Monday, November 25, British cabinet office minister Pat McFadden warned that Russian cyber criminals are increasingly targeting countries that support Ukraine, directing that Britain and its NATO allies must stay ahead in the AI arms race. He also stated that neither Britain nor its allies will be intimidated by Russian cyber threats to stop supporting Ukraine.

The remarks, given at the NATO Cyber Defence Conference in London, also unveil Britain's plans to set up a new Laboratory for AI (artificial intelligence) security to help create better cyber defense tools and organize intelligence on attacks. McFadden also emphasized businesses and institutions to do ""everything they can to lock their digital doors"" to protect themselves from what he called an increasingly aggressive Russia.
""While no one should underestimate the Russian aggressive and reckless cyber threat to NATO, we will not be intimidated by it and we will never allow it to dictate our decisions or policies. And we will do everything we can to defend our countries against it"".
McFadden will be sitting down with British businesses to discuss how they can boost their security in a few days.
In other AI news, lawyers for The New York Times and Daily News have revealed that OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to a case their company was being sued on. News publishers The New York Times and Daily News had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI. The legal proceedings required OpenAI to let the publishers look through its training datasets for any copyrighted content.
The search, which started on November 1st took a turn on November 14 when lawyers for the publishers alleged that search data stored on one of the virtual machines (after 150 hours of work) had vanished. While some data was recovered, it was without names and folder structure. The lawyers said it “cannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs’ copied articles were used to build [OpenAI’s] models”.

“News plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time...The news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week’s worth of its experts’ and lawyers’ work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today”.
OpenAI has been facing multiple lawsuits from publishers related to copyright infringement, even though it stands firm that it only trains its AI models on publicly available data.

ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, that helps enterprises automate multiple management workflows.
On November 25, Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained a “Buy” rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and a $1,150.00 price target. Key factors noted during a recent investor meeting have led to this buy rating. A larger renewal cohort is expected in 2025, initially constraining Current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) growth, but expected to potentially benefit from customers transitioning to Xanadu, a platform offering advanced GenAI capabilities. Another factor adding to the positive outlook is the disciplined approach to Pro Plus (the company's new generative AI SKU) pricing. The pressure on the Subscription Gross Margin in the coming year has already been factored into the analysis.

20241127,NOW,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.
In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.
However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Our proprietary system currently recommends ServiceNow (NOW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software that automates companies' technology operations is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for ServiceNow is 52.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ServiceNow is 33%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -13%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 33.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.1%.
Story Continues
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ServiceNow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.
Bottom Line

20241127,NOW,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ServiceNow’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.
View our latest analysis for ServiceNow
What's The Opportunity In ServiceNow?
ServiceNow appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$1,061 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $879.09. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like ServiceNow’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.
Can we expect growth from ServiceNow?
NYSE:NOW Earnings and Revenue Growth November 24th 2024
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ServiceNow. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
What This Means For You
Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NOW’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe NOW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NOW for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NOW, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

20241127,NOW,"ServiceNow stock (NOW) has been on a roll recently, boasting over 55% one-year returns, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500. While many are still bullish on further upside in the stock, we believe it's time to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the profits.
ServiceNow specializes in digital workflow automation, providing cloud-based workflow automation solutions that help organizations improve their operations. Its single data model that integrates various business functions into one platform is what makes this company unique because it boosts operational efficiency across departments.
The company's main product is the Now Platform, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single platform, enabling seamless collaboration and data flow across different business units, and allowing users to build custom applications for their specific needs.
Hard Disk, Hard Drive, Permanent Storage
The rest of ServiceNow's solutions allow organizations to automate their IT processes, improve employee interactions with human resources departments, manage security incidents, and enhance customer support and service interactions.
Approximately 95% of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscription fees for its cloud services. From a geographic point of view, North America is the largest contributor to revenue generating 63% of the total, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contribute 25%.
Some of its top clients are Accenture, Adidas, NASA, KPMG, Vodafone Group, Siemens, Cengage Group, and Epicor Software Corporation.
Our bearish thesis on the stock stems from two important factors: Carahsoft’s troubles with the Department of Justice and stock valuation.
Carahsoft is alleged to have engaged in price fixing for products sold to the US government. While ServiceNow isn’t directly named in the investigation, it is an important partner of Carahsoft. Its reliance on the US government for over a billion dollars in revenues has put a big question mark on the company’s future relations with the government.
In a best-case scenario, the company would get away with a fine. Worst case, their future revenues from the government become doubtful. This uncertainty is going to weigh on the stock price which is close to all-time highs, meaning there is room for a significant correction.
This also brings us to the question of valuation. Being at an all-time high doesn’t necessarily make a stock overvalued. However, at 59 times its free cash flow per share, the stock’s valuation is definitely high. Microsoft for instance trades at over 41 times its free cash flow per share. Granted ServiceNow can grow at a higher rate because of its small size. But is it really worth that risk? We don't think so.

In recent news reported by Reuters, a U.S. congressional commission proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart, or even smarter, than humans. The proposition is amid the intensifying competition from China over advanced technologies.
""We've seen throughout history that countries that are first to exploit periods of rapid technological change can often cause shifts in the global balance of power. China is racing towards AGI ... It's critical that we take them extremely seriously”
Helberg, while recognizing that energy infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for training large AI models, suggests that streamlining the permitting process for data centers is one way of enabling a public-private partnership that could accelerate AI development.

This news follows a rumor that artificial intelligence models are hitting a “wall”. Separate sources, including Reuters, The Information, and Bloomberg, have reported that companies such as OpenAI are failing in their next endeavors. Unnamed sources have claimed that OpenAI’s Orion is “so far not considered to be as big a step up from OpenAI’s existing models as GPT-4 was from GPT-3.5.”
However, OpenAI is pushing back on these rumors, stating that there is “no wall”. Despite having not reached a wall, analysts do admit that it’s possible to have reached a turning point.
“We haven’t seen a breakthrough model in a while. Part of it is that we’ve exhausted all the human data, and so just throwing more compute at the same data may not yield better results.”
Gary Marcus, NYU professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, has this to say:
“The economics are likely to be grim. LLMs will not disappear, even if improvements diminish, but the economics will likely never make sense…”
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Strong Liquidity Makes NOW Stock Attractive
A strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $5.295 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, is noteworthy. ServiceNow generated a free cash flow of $471 million in the third quarter of 2024.
NOW expects the free cash flow margin to be 31% for 2024.
The strong liquidity position allows ServiceNow to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases.
In the third quarter of 2024, NOW repurchased roughly 272,000 shares for $225 million and had $562 million available for future share repurchases under the existing program.
NOW’s Strong Prospects Justify Premium Valuation
However, the NOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.
In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, NOW is trading at 16.28, higher than its median of 13.74 and the sector’s 6.21.

20241127,NOW,"ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ServiceNow's ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Check out our latest analysis for ServiceNow
How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
ROE can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ServiceNow is:
14% = US$1.3b ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.
What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
ServiceNow's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE
To start with, ServiceNow's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for ServiceNow's significant 37% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ServiceNow's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 20% in the same period, which is great to see.
NYSE:NOW Past Earnings Growth November 19th 2024
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ServiceNow's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.

Is ServiceNow Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?
ServiceNow doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Conclusion
On the whole, we feel that ServiceNow's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

20241127,NOW,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market:
“When it's loved in this market, it's really loved, but when it's hated, I mean just forget about it. That's been the dynamic ever since the election.”

Cramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams.
Another sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring.
While some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks.
Similarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they’re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices.
As for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they’ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks.

“We need to see the floor of the abyss, unless, of course, we’re bouncing off it already. And for the overly loved, don't look for Trump for support. He can surprise you with what concerns him. Do not get too cocky. Do not get too smug. It will hurt you for certain.”

Cramer recently talked about ServiceNow, Inc.’s (NYSE:NOW) parabolic move and said:
“Let's start with love: This market [is] once again enamored with those enterprise software stocks that are so expensive… Now these have all had parabolic moves, up double digits this month, even if they all pulled back a little bit today. If you're selling software to big business, you can do no wrong in this market… Now see, with ServiceNow, a very good company that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the enterprise workflow among many other things. ServiceNow now sells for just under 75 times earnings. I had to take it outta the Charitable Trust bullpen today at our CNBC Investing Club monthly meeting… Darn thing just went too parabolic for me again… Now, enterprise software does tend to not have much Chinese exposure, which is a positive heading into Trump's second term. How much is that worth? Not clear. At the CNBC Investing Club meeting, Jeff Marks and I talked about which companies could be helped or hurt by Trump 2.0. Enterprise software, it came out unscathed. I think that should put a premium on enterprise software stocks. But at this point, enough is enough. I say let 'em come down and then you can buy.”
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a leading provider of digital solutions designed to help businesses automate workflows and enhance operational efficiency across a variety of enterprise functions. According to the company, more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies rely on its platform, contributing to a customer base that exceeds 8,100 organizations worldwide.
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has continued to experience strong growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported total revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, more than $2.7 billion was generated from subscription-based services. This marks a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year.
Additionally, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.72, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company’s customer base has also expanded, with the number of clients generating net annual contract value (ACV) of $1 million or more rising by 14%, bringing the total to 2,020 customers with more than $1 million in ACV.
Overall NOW ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

Sovereign AI: a new concept gaining traction in the realm of artificial intelligence. As reported by CNBC, tech giants are developing “sovereign” artificial intelligence models to boost their competitiveness. Last month, Denmark revealed its very own artificial intelligence supercomputer, becoming one of many sovereign AI initiatives that have the ability to “codify” a country’s culture, history, and collective intelligence.

That said, many of the biggest large language models today, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, have US-based data centers for storing data and processing requests from the cloud. Several politicians and regulators hailing from Europe are beginning to raise concern over this, who believe that dependence on US technology is harmful to their continent’s competitiveness and technological resilience.
Filippo Sanesi, global head of marketing and operations at OVHCloud, noted that the French cloud firm is experiencing lots of demand for its European-located infrastructure, as they “understand the value of having their data in Europe, which are subject to European legislation.”
“As this concept of data sovereignty becomes more mature and people understand what it means, we see more and more companies understanding the importance of having your data locally and under a specific jurisdiction and governance. We have a lot of data. This data is sovereign in specific countries, under specific regulations.”
While AI sovereignty is not yet a regulatory mandate, European countries are increasingly investing in AI technologies that are reflective of their own societal norms.
Latest Advancements in AI
In recent news, more than 3,000 companies from around the world participated in Lisbon’s Web Summit 2024. The theme for Europe’s largest technology event was artificial intelligence, with startups showcasing machines that could think and learn, and even solve many of the world’s problems, such as deforestation. One such startup at the summit was Woodchat, an artificial intelligence system identifying lumber types to combat the use of illegal wood.
“WoodChat is an artificial intelligence system that identifies lumber types, and the whole thing is done via WhatsApp. Our technology is an API verified by Meta. In Brazil, our recognition system is used to fill out forestry documents. The process helps loggers to fill it out so that the wood passes through the federal system with authorised certification”.

Other fields with interesting startups at the summit were robotics, finance, and also air travel.
In other AI news, OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research organization, is preparing to launch a new artificial intelligence operator codenamed “Operator”, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly set to launch the tool as a research preview in January, allowing a computer to take action on a human’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. The planned release is part of a wider industry movement towards agents—AI software capable of performing multi-step tasks for users with minimal oversight.
